<h2>ORKNEY</h2>

<h2 class="left"><a name="Section_1" id="Section_1"></a> 1.  County and Shire</h2>


<p>The word <em>shire</em> is of Old English origin, and meant
charge, administration. The Norman Conquest introduced
an alternative designation, the word <em>county</em>&mdash;through
Old French from Latin <em>comitatus</em>, which in
mediaeval documents stands for shire. <em>County</em> denotes
the district under a count, the king’s <i>comes</i>, the equivalent
of the older English term <em>earl</em>. This system of local
administration entered Scotland as part of the Anglo-Norman
influence that strongly affected our country
after 1100.</p>

<p>The exceptional character of the historical nexus
between the Orkney Islands and Scotland, makes it
somewhat difficult to fix definitely the date at which
Orkney can be fairly said to have first constituted a
Scottish county. For a period of about one hundred
and fifty years after the conditional and, to all intent,
temporary cession of the Islands to Scotland in the
year 1468, Scottish and Norse law overlapped each other
to a large extent in Orkney. And although during that
period the Scottish Crown both invested earls, and
appointed sheriffs of Orkney, yet so long as Norse law
subsisted in the Islands, as it did largely in practice
and absolutely in theory until the year 1612, it is hardly
possible to consider Orkney a Scottish county. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>relation of the Islands towards Scotland during this
confused period of fiscal evolution bears more resemblance
to that of the Isle of Man towards England at
the present day. When, however, in the year 1612 an
Act of the Scottish Privy Council applied the general
law of Scotland to the Islands, although the proceeding
was in defiance of the conditions of their cession, Orkney
may be held to have at last entered into the full comity
of Scottish civil life, and may thenceforth, without
impropriety or cavil, be considered and spoken of as
the County or Shire of Orkney.</p>

<p>The Latin name <i>Orcades</i> implies the islands adjacent
to Cape Orcas, a promontory first mentioned by Diodorus
Siculus about 57 <span class="smcaps">b.c.</span> as one of the northern extremities
of Britain, and commonly held to be Dunnet Head.</p>

<p>The Norse name was <em>Orkneyar</em>, of which our <em>Orkney</em>
is a curtailment. The name <em>orc</em> appears to have been
applied by both Celtic and Teutonic races to some half-mythical
sea-monster, which according to Ariosto, in
<em>Orlando Furioso</em>, devoured men and women; but
the suggested connection between this animal and the
name of the county appears a little far-fetched, although
the large number of whales in the surrounding waters is
quoted to support it.</p>

</div>

<p>Orkney occupies the somewhat anomalous position
of being a wholly insular shire whose economic interests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>are overwhelmingly agricultural. Most of the islands
are flat or low; and in several, such as Shapinsay,
Stronsay, Sanday, and South Ronaldshay, the proportion
of cultivated land exceeds 70 per cent. of their total
areas. In the Mainland, however, there are large
stretches of hill and moorland, while in Hoy and Walls
the natural conditions of by far the greater portion of
the island closely approximate to those of the Scottish
Highlands. Rousay is the only other island which is
to a large extent hilly; but Westray and Eday have
some hills, and Burray, Flotta, and several other islands
considerable stretches of low-lying moor. The general
rise of the land is from N.E. to S.W. A height of 334
feet is attained at the Ward Hill at the south end of Eday,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>880 feet at the Ward Hill of Orphir, in the S.W. of
the Mainland, 1420 at Cuilags, 1564 at Ward Hill,
and 1309 at Knap of Trowieglen, the three highest
points in Hoy and in the whole group. Exceptionally
fine views are obtained from Wideford Hill (741 feet),
near Kirkwall, and from the Ward Hill in Hoy, the
varied panoramas of islands, sounds, and lakes perhaps
gaining in grace of outline more than they lose in
richness of detail from the woodless character of the
country.</p>

<p>Taken in detail, and viewed from the low ground,
however, the general aspect of much of the country
is bleak, and only redeemed from baldness by the widely-spread
evidence of a vigorous cultivation. Yet for
reasons of a somewhat complex texture, involving
meteorological conditions, historical and archaeological
considerations, and a touch of all-round individuality,
the Islands rarely fail to cast a spell upon the visitor.
One might quote many distinguished writers to vouch
for this fact, but an Orcadian poet has depicted the
telling features of his native land, both physical and
psychic, with unerring accuracy and skill.</p>

<p>If we allow a little for the softer side of the picture,
a side perhaps best typified by the fine old buildings
of the little island capital, and the spell of the lightful
midsummer night, which is no night, the lines of Vedder
form a fair compendium of the natural conditions and

much of the “bleak and treeless moor” of the poet’s

of corn.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left"><a name="Section_3" id="Section_3"></a> 3.  Size.  Situation.  Boundaries</h2>


<p>The Orkney Islands extend between the parallels
58° 41´ and 59° 24´ of north latitude, and 2° 22´ and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>3° 26´ of west longitude. They measure 56 miles from
north-east to south-west, and 29 miles from east to west,
and cover 240,476 acres or 375.5 square miles, exclusive
of fresh water lochs. The group is bounded by the
North Sea and the Pentland Firth on the south, the
Atlantic on the west, Sumburgh Roost on the north,
and the North Sea on the east. Our measurements take
no account of the distant Sule Skerry, an islet of 35
acres lying 32½ miles north-west of Hoy Head, and
inhabited only by lightkeepers and innumerable birds.
The archipelago is naturally divided into three sections:
the Mainland in the centre, the South Isles including
all islands to the south, and the North Isles all to the
north, of the Mainland. The Mainland&mdash;the Norse
<em>Meginland</em>, or <em>Hrossey</em>, <i>i.e.</i> Horse Island&mdash;covers 190
square miles, and is 25 miles long from north-west to
south-east, and 15 miles broad from east to west. It
is divided into two unequal portions, the East Mainland
and the West Mainland, by an isthmus less than two
miles across, which connects Kirkwall Bay on its north
sea-board with Scapa Flow, a large and picturesque
inland sea, now well known as a naval base, which lies
between its south coasts and the encircling South Isles.
The name Pomona, stamped on the Mainland by George
Buchanan’s misapprehension of a Latin text, is never
applied to the island by Orcadians; and here be it also
said that Hoy and Walls, the largest of the South Isles
and the second in size of the whole group (13½ miles
long by about 5½ miles broad, and covering 36,674
acres), although one island geographically, is colloquially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>two. The principal of the other South Isles are South
Ronaldshay, 13,080 acres; Burray, 2682 acres; Flotta,
2661 acres; Graemsay, 1151 acres; and Fara, 840 acres.
Scapa Flow is connected with the Pentland Firth to
the south by Hoxa Sound, with the Atlantic to the
west by Hoy Sound, and with the North Sea to the east
by Holm Sound. The largest of the North Isles are
Sanday, 16,498 acres; Westray, 13,096 acres; Rousay,
11,937 acres; Stronsay, 9839 acres; Eday, 7371
acres; Shapinsay, 7171 acres; Papa Westray, 2403
acres; North Ronaldshay, 2386 acres; and Egilsay,
1636 acres. This section of the archipelago is itself
divided into two portions by the waterway formed by
the Stronsay and Westray Firths, which runs from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>south-east to north-west through the islands, and offers
an alternative to the Pentland Firth or Sumburgh
Roost passages for vessels passing between the North
Sea and the Atlantic.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_007.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="458" />
<p class="captioncenter">The Home Fleet in Scapa Flow</p>
</div>

<p>The whole archipelago includes some 67 islands,
besides a score or more of islets, but only 30 are inhabited,
and four or five of these are occupied solely by lighthouse
attendants and their families. Small uninhabited
islands, many of which are used as pasturage, are known
as “holms.” The largest uninhabited island is the
Calf of Eday, of 590 acres, but some 10 of the inhabited
islands are of less area than this.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left"> <a name="Section_4" id="Section_4"></a> 4.  Streams and Lakes</h2>


<p>The streams of Orkney are, of course, mere burns of
a few miles in length, draining the high ground, and
save for the cheap motive power which they offer to
farmers and millers, of interest only to anglers. Nowhere
in Orkney are trees so much missed as along the burnsides,
and for that reason the Burn of Berriedale, a branch
of the larger Rackwick Burn, in Hoy, whose steep banks
are covered with poplar, birch, hazel, and mountain ash,
is a sort of Mecca to the aesthetic Orcadian. The broad
estuary of the Loch of Stenness, which disembogues
into the Bay of Ireland, though of trifling length, is the
nearest approach to a river that the Islands can present.
It is known as the <em>Bush</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_009.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="436" />
<p class="captioncenter">Loch of Kirbuster, in Orphir</p>
</div>

<p>From a spectacular point of view the many lakes of
Orkney go far to compensate the county for the absence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>of rivers. So many are they that it is hardly possible
to get out of sight of salt or fresh water in the Islands.
The great twin lochs of Harray and Stenness, at once
joined and separated by the Bridge of Brogar, give
a strong dash of picturesqueness to the whole central
part of the West Mainland; and still more beautiful
are the secluded and hill-surrounded Heldale Water
and Hoglinns Water in Walls. Other lochs are Boardhouse,
Swannay, Hundland, Isbister, Skaill, Banks,
Sabiston, Clumly and Bosquoy in the West Mainland;
Kirbuster in Orphir, Tankerness in the East Mainland;
Muckle Water, Peerie (<i>i.e.</i> little) Water, and Wasbister
in Rousay; <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Tredwell Loch in Papa Westray;
Saintear and Swartmill in Westray; Muckle Water in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Stronsay; and Bea, Longmay, and North Loch in
Sanday. The total area of Orkney lakes is about 20,000
acres. In most of them fishing is free, in others permission
to fish is readily obtainable. The Loch Stenness
trout is, according to Gunther, a distinct species, but
this is a vexed question among the learned in such
matters. Heldale Water contains Norwegian char in
addition to trout.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left"> <a name="Section_5" id="Section_5"></a> 5.  Geology and Soil</h2>


<p>The geological formation of the Orkney Islands is,
in its main features, of a very simple nature. If we
except a comparatively small strip of land running
northwestward from Stromness to Inganess in the West
Mainland, and a still smaller patch in the neighbouring
island of Graemsay, practically the whole county is
underlain by the Old Red Sandstone formation. The
two small areas above-mentioned&mdash;practically one,
save for the intervening sea&mdash;are occupied by older
crystalline rocks, consisting of fine-grained granite,
and micaceous schist at times running into foliated
granite, the whole traversed by veins of pink felsite.
These formations are flanked on either side by a narrow
band of conglomerate of the Middle Old Red Sandstone
period, composed of the rounded pebbles of the underlying
schist and granite. Of the Old Red Sandstone
two divisions are found in the Islands&mdash;the Middle or
Orcadian, and the Upper Old Red Sandstone. There
are also in various parts but especially in Hoy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Deerness, local outcrops of volcanic material. Orkney
thus constitutes practically a continuation of the north-eastern
Highlands of Scotland, and, as in Caithness,
flagstone is by far the most widely distributed rock.</p>

<p>The Orcadian or Middle Old Red Sandstone is known
to be a fresh water deposit, laid down by a large system
of lakes which once extended over the north-eastern
Highlands as far south as Inverness and Banff, and the
same species of fossil fishes are found in the grey and
black flagstones near Stromness as in the red sandstones
on the south coasts of the Moray Firth. Leaving out
of account the small area of crystalline rocks near
Stromness, which are of age long anterior to any of
the Old Red Sandstone deposits, the West Mainland
parishes of Stromness, Sandwick, and Birsay contain
the oldest rocks within the county, the Stromness
flagstones with the fishes embedded in them being coeval
with the Achanarras beds of Caithness. Next in point
of age, come the flagstones of the East Mainland and
the North Isles, corresponding in date and fossil remains
to what are known to geologists as the Thurso Beds of
Caithness. Following these in order of antiquity
come the yellow and red sandstones and the dark red
clays or marls which occur in the northern part of South
Ronaldshay, and in Deerness, Shapinsay, and Eday.
These are known as the John O’ Groats Beds, from their
occurrence in that part of Caithness also, where indeed
they were first exhaustively investigated. These three
members of the Middle or Orcadian Old Red Sandstone
are supposed to have a combined thickness of not less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>than 7000 feet, though this pile of sediment represents
only the upper half of the formation, the lower beds
of Caithness apparently not being represented north
of the Pentland Firth.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="434" />
<p class="captioncenter">Berry Head, Hoy</p>
</div>

<p>After the Middle Old Red Sandstone had stood for
many ages as dry land, the eroding action of the atmosphere,
rain, and streams gradually eliminated all inequalities
and produced a nearly level surface, upon
which by degrees a new lake was formed, occupying a
large part of Orkney and Caithness. In this lake sand
accumulated, which now forms the highest hills of
Orkney. The yellow sandstones of the Hoy and Walls
hills are deposits of this lake, and belong to the Upper
Old Red Sandstone, which is not represented in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>other islands of the archipelago, but reappears at Dunnet
Head on the south side of the Pentland Firth.</p>

<p>Flagstone is a material that yields readily to the
influence of the weather, and the subsoil formed is a
rubble consisting of loose fragments of rock embedded
in a brown clay formed by the softer and more weathered
portion of the underlying rock. This gives a well-drained
soil, and as the flagstones always contain lime,
potash, and phosphates, and are frequently mixed
with sand, the resultant soil may be generally described
as a clayey loam of moderate fertility. Soil of this
character covers a large part of the flagstone formation
of Orkney, especially where the land is of moderate
elevation, and surface accumulations of boulder-clay,
or alluvium are at a minimum. At higher elevations
on the other hand the character of the flagstone soils
is frequently modified by the presence of peat. The
soils of the sandstone formation, which occur in parts
of South Ronaldshay and Hoy, and to a larger extent
in Burray and Eday, are of inferior fertility, partly on
account of their more porous nature. In Burray and
Eday a large portion of the sandstone districts are
in consequence left uncultivated, and utilised only as
rough pasture. The same is true of the soils of the
Upper Old Red Sandstone formation, which covers
by far the larger portion of the parishes of Hoy and
Walls, but most of this land is, in any case, above the
altitude to which cultivation is usually carried in Orkney.</p>

<p>Of “drifts,” or loose surface deposits, the boulder-clay
is the only one that materially affects the agricultural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>quality of the soils of the Islands as a whole. The
boulder-clay of Orkney, which on account of the particular
direction&mdash;northwestwards over the Islands from
the North Sea&mdash;taken by the ice at the period when
the archipelago was subjected to glaciation, contains
a considerable additional quantity of lime in the form
of shells scraped up from the bed of the ocean, overlies
the rock formations in the lower grounds over a large
portion of the county. This deposit, which varies in
thickness from less than a foot up to forty feet or more,
has been calculated to occupy at least one-third of the
area of the Islands, and it provides the most fertile soil
that the county contains, particularly where the land
has been improved by long cultivation and artificial
drainage.</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter" />
<h2 class="left"> <a name="Section_6" id="Section_6"></a> 6.   Natural History</h2>


<p>The outstanding features of Orcadian zoology are
naturally the very restricted number of land mammals
as compared with that of the neighbouring mainland
of Scotland, the relatively large number of cetaceans
in the surrounding waters, and, above all, the richness
of the avifauna, particularly in sea-birds, and autumn
and winter visitants from more northerly climes.</p>

<p>Although the bones and antlers of the red deer have
been found among the matter excavated from the sites
of brochs and Picts’ houses, and their shed horns at
times turn up among the peat-mosses of the Mainland,
that king of British Cervidæ was unknown to Orkney
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>during historic times until about the year 1860, when
two young hinds and a young stag were introduced into
Walls. There they throve perfectly, and had increased
to thirteen or fourteen by 1870-72, when the proprietor
of the island found it necessary to kill them off, on
account of the damage which they were doing to crops.
Tusks of the wild boar have been found at Skaill in the
West Mainland, but the wolf, fox, badger, and in fact
practically all of the larger land mammals known to
Britain during historic times, or still found there to-day,
have been totally unknown in Orkney during the same
period. The otter is a notable exception, as it is very
abundant in most of the islands, the great extent of
sea-board giving it special facilities for concealment and
avoidance of capture. An Orcadian proprietor who
died a few years ago has recorded that in his young
days he often had as many as thirty otter skins in his
possession at one time.</p>

<p>The common hare appears to have been introduced
into Orkney by a Mr Moodie of Melsetter, early in the
eighteenth century, but both that attempt at acclimatisation
and one by Malcolm Laing, the historian, in 1818,
proved comparative failures. Better success, however,
attended the efforts of Mr Samuel Laing and Mr Baikie
of Tankerness about 1830, and at the present day, hares
are found in the Mainland, Rousay, Eday, Shapinsay,
Hoy, and South Ronaldshay. The white hare occurred
in Hoy at an early date, as recorded by Jo Ben, a resident
in Orkney, in his <cite>Descriptio Insularum Orchadiarum</cite>,
in 1529:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Albi lepores hic sunt, et capiuntur canibus.”</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>It died out, however, and has only recently been reintroduced.
The rabbit is common throughout the
Islands. Of other and less desirable rodents, the black
rat was once general in South Ronaldshay, and probably
still occurs there. The brown rats, common in most
parts of Orkney, have been known at times to forsake
certain islands altogether, taking to the sea in a body
in search of a new home. The field mouse, and the
house mouse are universal. The common field vole is
plentiful in most of the islands, and there is a doubtful
record of the water vole from Hoy. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Microtus orcadensis</i>,
or the Orkney vole discovered in 1904, is a highly
interesting species peculiar to Orkney and certain parts
of Shetland. The common shrew has been found in
Walls and Orphir, and the water shrew in Walls. Bats
are rare in Orkney, but occurrences of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vesperugo pipistrellus</i>
have been recorded from Walls, Sanday, and
Kirkwall, of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vespertilio murinus</i> from Walls; while
there is an interesting but doubtful record of a specimen
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vesperugo noctula</i> having been captured in South
Ronaldshay.</p>

<p>Appearances of the walrus in Orkney waters have
been recorded from Eday, Hoy Sound, and Walls at
various dates from 1825 to 1864; and Orkney seals
include <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phoca vitulina</i>, which breeds on several islands
and skerries, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phoca groenlandica</i>, and the grey seal.
The occurrence of the hooded seal is doubtful. Among
Cetacea, the Greenland and sperm whales are rare
visitors, the hump-backed whale, still rarer; but the
common rorquall, Sibbald’s rorquall, the lesser
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>rorquall, the beaked whale, the grampus, the common
porpoise, and the white-sided dolphin are all fairly
common. The bottlenose is, however, <i>the</i> Orkney
whale, occurring at times in schools of 500 in number.
The bottlenosed dolphin and the white-beaked dolphin
are also on record.</p>

<p>The ornithology of Orkney comprises about 235
species, and owing to the special physical characteristics
of the Islands bird-life forms a more conspicuous
feature of landscape and sea than it does perhaps anywhere
else in the British Islands. In a district where
travel is more usual on sea than on land, and where
the lakes, the fields, the hills, and the moors are unshrouded
by woods, not only are aquatic birds a more
constant object of the view than in districts otherwise
conditioned, but the commoner land birds also are more
frequently and readily observed.</p>

<p>Of the Falconidæ 17 species have been killed or
observed in the Islands, being practically all of this
family known to Britain, except the orange-legged
falcon and the bee hawk. The golden eagle and the
white-tailed eagle, however, both of which formerly
bred in Hoy, are now only occasional visitants. The
peregrine falcon is still fairly common, and in old days
the King’s falconer procured them from the Islands for
sporting purposes. Of the Strigidæ, the long-eared
owl, the short-eared owl, the snowy owl, the tawny owl,
Tengmalm’s owl, and the eagle owl have all been observed;
but recorded occurrences of the barn owl and
the little owl are of doubtful authenticity. Of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>order Anseres, of which some 32 species have been
observed in the Islands, the rarest locally are perhaps
the greylag goose, the pink-footed goose, the Canada
goose, the gadwall, the shoveller, the Garganey teal,
the king eider, the harlequin duck, the common scoter,
the surf scoter, Bewick’s swan, and the goosander.
The common eider duck is plentiful. Regular winter
visitants, but not unknown at other seasons, are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>long-tailed duck, the velvet scoter, and the smew.
Other visitants are the bernacle goose, the brent goose,
the white-fronted goose, and the hooper, the last two
in particular being common frequenters of the larger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>lochs, such as Stenness, Harray, and Boardhouse at
this season. Of some 18 species of the Laridæ found
in Orkney, the rarest are perhaps the Iceland gull, the
glaucous gull, the common skua, the pomatorhine
skua, and Richardson’s skua, the last-named, however,
breeding in Walls. Of the Colymbidæ, the red-throated
diver breeds in Walls, while the black-throated and
great northern divers are winter visitants, both suspected
to have occasionally stayed to breed. Of the
Alcidae, the razor-bill, common guillemot, black guillemot,
puffin, and little auk are usual. In the crevice
of a cliff in Papa Westray lived the last Orkney great
auk, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alca impennis</i>, shot in 1813, and now in the Natural
History Museum, South Kensington, an interesting
specimen of a bird probably now everywhere extinct.
Of the Scolopacidae about 22 species are on record.
Yarrell is perhaps in error when he mentions the avocet
as having been found in the Islands, but the red-necked
phalarope was first recorded as a British species from
Stronsay in 1769. The gray phalarope is rare. The
woodcock comes in winter, and has bred in Rousay.
The common snipe is plentiful, and the jack snipe and
double snipe come in autumn. The little stint, purple
sandpiper, sanderling, knot, ruff, bartailed godwit,
black-tailed godwit, spotted redshank, and the greenshank
are all found, but some of these are rare. Of
the Charadriidae, the golden, grey, and ringed plovers,
the lapwing, dotterel, and turnstone are common,
while the eastern golden plover has been found. Of
the order Tubinares, the stormy petrel and the Manx
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>shearwater breed, and the fulmar petrel has become a
common visitant of recent years. The Rallidae are
represented by the land-rail, water-rail, spotted crake,
moor-hen, and common coot, and the Gruidae by the
common and demoiselle cranes. The common heron
alone is usual among the Herodii, although the bittern,
little bittern, white stork, spoonbill, and glossy ibis
have all been found. Of the Podicipitidae, the
Sclavonian, great-crested, eared, and little grebes are
known, the last-named, however, being the only nester.
Of the Pelicanidae, the solan goose breeds on the distant
Stack, near Sule Skerry, and the shag and cormorant
are common. Of the Columbidae the rock-dove is
common, the ring-dove occasionally breeds in plantations,
and the stock-dove and turtle-dove are seen at times.
Of the order Passeres, the usual nesters include the
song-thrush, blackbird, redbreast, wren, pied wagtail,
rock pipit, linnet, twite, greenfinch, yellow bunting,
skylark, and common starling, the last a bird perhaps
more frequent in the Islands than anywhere else.
Scarcer breeders are the missel-thrush, stonechat, ring-ouzel,
golden-crested wren, sedge warbler, grey wagtail,
yellow wagtail, hedge-sparrow, meadow pipit, pied
flycatcher, swallow, sand-martin, chaffinch, lesser redpole,
and reed bunting. Common winter visitants are
the redwing, fieldfare, and snow bunting, while rarer
or only occasional comers are the dipper, redstart, blackcap,
chiffchaff, fire-crested wren, willow wren, great
titmouse, blue titmouse, common creeper, grey-headed
wagtail, tree pipit, great grey shrike, red-backed shrike.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>waxwing, spotted flycatcher, rose pastor, goldfinch,
brambling, mealy redpole, common bullfinch, common
crossbill, and wood lark. Orkney Corvidae include
the grey crow, the rook, the jackdaw (South Ronaldshay
only), and the raven as breeding species, while the
magpie and nutcracker are rare visitants. Of the
Picidae, the great spotted woodpecker is an irregular
autumn and winter visitant, while the lesser spotted
woodpecker, the green woodpecker, and the wryneck
are seen at times. Of the order Coccyges, the cuckoo is
fairly common, while the roller, hoopoe, and common
kingfisher have been found. Of the order Macrochires
the common swift and the common nightjar are occasionally
seen.</p>

<p>Of game and other sport-yielding birds, the red grouse
breeds in the Mainland, Rousay, Eday, Hoy, Walls,
Flotta and Fara. Grouse disease is unknown in Orkney,
and the birds of Walls and Rousay are the heaviest
in Scotland. Various attempts to acclimatise the black
grouse, partridge, red-legged partridge, and pheasant
have all practically failed. The ptarmigan bred in
Hoy until 1831. Pallas’s sand grouse at times visit
the Islands in considerable numbers, and are surmised
to have bred in several islands. The quail comes
in much the same way, if in fewer numbers, and has
nested, though rarely.</p>

<p>The plant-life of the Islands, however interesting to
the scientifically-equipped botanist, presents no such
happy hunting-ground to the unsophisticated lover of
wild nature as does their bird-life. The practical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>non-existence of woods conspires with the cool summer
and high winds of the country to restrict both the
number and the distribution of its flora. Ferns in
particular are of circumscribed distribution, a loss to
the beauty of the country-side only less conspicuous
than that caused by the absence of woods; while
several other popular and showy plants, such as the
wild rose, the foxglove, gorse, and broom are of only
too limited a range. Some 20 species or varieties of
ferns are known or reported, of which <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ophioglossum
vulgatum, var. ambiguum</i>, was for years unknown out
of the Islands. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zannichellia polycarpa</i>, a pond-weed,
was for some time known as a British plant only from
the Loch of Kirbuster in Orphir; and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carex fulva</i>, a
sedge, was at one period peculiar to the same parish.
More interesting, however, is the recent discovery by
Mr Magnus Spence, who has lately published the first
complete <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flora orcadensis</i>, of a plant which Mr C. E.
Moss, D. Sc., of Cambridge, considers to be either a
new variety of the dainty <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Primula scotica</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Primula
stricta</i>, a species hitherto unknown to the flora of the
British Isles. The common variety of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Primula scotica</i>
is fairly abundant in many of the islands. Hoy is the
most interesting of the islands from a botanical point
of view, as it contains a variety of plants unknown to
the others. Perhaps the most interesting of these is
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Loiseleuria procumbens</i>, the trailing azalea, which
makes a beautiful show in its season on several spots
among the higher hills. This island also contains in
several of its more sheltered glens practically the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>indigenous trees that Orkney can boast of, consisting
of somewhat stunted specimens of hazel, birch, mountain
ash, quaking poplar, and honeysuckle. Before the
days of the Baltic timber trade the dying Orcadian
must have been gravely concerned over the disposition
of the family porridge-stick, or “pot-tree,” as it was
locally styled. Even to-day, with some plantations
around certain mansion-houses, it is doubtful whether
all the trees in the county, indigenous and introduced,
would cover a sixty-acre field. We subjoin a list of
a few of the rarer Orkney plants, with some of their
localities.</p>

<p>The total number of plants found in the Islands, not
counting varieties, is about 560, a number slightly in
excess of that of Shetland and slightly fewer than that
of Caithness, to the floras of which counties that of
Orkney closely assimilates.</p>

<h2 class="left"><a name="Section_7" id="Section_7"></a> 7. The Coast</h2>


<p>In a district where, despite the general existence of
good roads, the shortest cut to church, post office, smithy,
or mill is often by crossing a sound or skirting the shore
in a yawl, the coastline spells something more than a
mere alternation of cliffs and sandy beaches, diversified
by the occasional appearance of a lighthouse or a harbour.
Such things of course the shores of Orkney exhibit in
no common measure, but to show how far they are
from exhausting the coastal features of Orcadian life
and scenery, it is only necessary to say that of twenty-one
civil parishes in the county all but one (Harray)
possess miles of sea-board, and that of the centres of
population, only some two or three hamlets are inland.
No spot in the Mainland is above five miles from the
coast, no point in any other island more than three
miles.</p>

<p>The general configuration of the coasts may be best
studied on the map, but as not every inlet of the sea
forms a good natural anchorage, we here indicate some
that do so. Others, and some of these the most important,
are mentioned in the final section. Widewall
Bay on the W. side of South Ronaldshay, Panhope in
Flotta, and Echnaloch on the N.W. of Burray are, after
the far-famed Longhope in Walls, the best anchorages
in the South Isles. The Bay of Ireland, known to
mariners as Cairston Roads, is on the south coast of
Mainland, a little to the eastward of Stromness. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>ganess
Bay and Deer Sound are in the N.E. of Mainland;
Veantrow Bay on the N. side of Shapinsay;
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Catherine’s Bay, Mill Bay, and Holland Bay in
Stronsay; and Otterswick in Sanday. There are deepwater
piers&mdash;as indispensable adjuncts of traffic in
Orkney as railway stations are elsewhere&mdash;at Longhope,
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Margaret’s Hope, and Burray in the South Isles; at
Stromness, Swanbister Bay, Scapa Bay, and Holm on the
S. coast of Mainland; at Kirkwall and Finstown on the
N. coast of Mainland; and in Shapinsay, Stronsay,
Eday, Rousay, Sanday Westray, Egilsay, and North
Ronaldshay in the North Isles.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>Lying as they do athwart a main trade route from
the ports of northern and western Europe to America
and the western ports of Britain, the rock-girded and
wind-swept shores of Orkney are especially well lighted.
Indeed it is probable that from the summit of the Ward
Hill of Hoy on a clear night more lighthouses can be
discerned than from any other point in Britain. Stromness
is an important centre of operations for the Scottish
Lighthouse Board, lying half-way between the east
and west coasts of Scotland, and having the many lighthouses
of Shetland to the north.</p>

<p>The coasts and sounds of Orkney are studded with
innumerable skerries and sunken reefs. Few of these
call for any special notice, but the reader should know
that in a few cases&mdash;Auskerry, the larger Pentland
Skerry, Sule Skerry&mdash;the name skerry is locally applied
to soil-covered islets of considerable area. There are
no raised beaches in Orkney, all oceanological and
geological data going to show that the islands were
once united, and the coastline in consequence at a lower
level than it occupies to-day. Traces of submerged
forests are to be found at Widewall Bay, in South
Ronaldshay, and a few other localities. Coast erosion
in the Islands is too slight a factor to have any practical
significance.</p>

<p>Apart from the fine natural harbours, the outstanding
physical feature of the Orkney coasts is the gigantic
cliff scenery of the Atlantic sea-board, particularly
that of Hoy and Walls, which both for loftiness and
splendour of colouring stands unrivalled in Britain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>For a distance of about two miles from the Kaim of Hoy
southwards to the Sow the average height of the cliffs
is above 1000 feet, the huge rampant culminating about
midway between these two points in <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> John’s Head,
also called Braeborough, which attains a height of
1140 feet. About a mile southward of the Sow stands
the famous Old Man of Hoy (450 feet), tallest of British
“stacks”&mdash;</p>

      <div class="verse">Whose ruined scalp seems thunder-riven.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Of many other fine cliffs in this island we have space
to mention only the Berry, in Walls, a sheer precipice
of 600 feet in height, which forms, so to speak, one of the
jaws of the Pentland Firth, the other jaw being Dunnet
Head on the Caithness side. For beauty of colouring
and indeed of outline, the Berry excels any cliff in this
wonderful coastline, which the late Dr Guthrie described
as, after Niagara and the Alps, the most sublime sight in
the world. There is much fine rock scenery elsewhere
in the Islands, particularly in the West Mainland,
Rousay, Eday, and South Ronaldshay.</p>

<p>The tideways in many of the sounds which separate
the various islands are remarkable for their turbulence
and velocity, a speed of 8 knots an hour being reached
in Hoy Sound, and 12 knots in the Pentland Firth. In
the Pentland Firth also are two whirlpools, the Wells
of Swona and the Swelkie of Stroma, the latter as
famous in fable as the by no means more formidable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>Maelström. The total coastline of the Islands extends
to between 500 and 600 miles.</p>


<div class="chapter" />
<h2 class="left"> <a name="Section_8" id="Section_8"></a> 8. Weather and Climate</h2>


<p>Insular climates are almost invariably milder than
those of continents, or even those of the inland regions
of large islands, in the same latitudes, and the climate
of Orkney is no exception to this rule. Like so many
other things Orcadian, the climate is conditioned by the
proximity of the sea, and in this case by a sea whose
waters are considerably warmer than their latitude
might lead one to suspect. The warm surface drift
of the North Atlantic is of itself sufficient to explain
the relatively mild winter of Orkney, and the presence
of the widest portion of the North Sea on the eastern
side of the Islands has also a modifying influence. It
must also be borne in mind that in cool climates rain
brings heat. Our westerly and south-westerly winds,
passing over sun-bathed seas, collect in their courses
the vapour of warmer climates, and when this vapour,
coming into contact with the cooler air of more northerly
latitudes, is again condensed into water, a certain amount
of the heat thus collected is set free, and raises the
temperature of the air, of the rain itself, and of the
land on which it falls.</p>

of Orkney is 45.4°, which compares with 46.3° at Aberdeen
and at Alnwick in Northumberland, and with 49.4°
at Kew Observatory. The total range of temperature
is only about 16°, as against 20° at Thurso, just across
the Pentland Firth, 22° at Leith, and 25° at London.
In this respect the Islands resemble the S.W. coast of
England and the W. coast of Ireland. The lowest
temperature recorded in Orkney in the eighty-seven
years during which meteorological observations have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>been made was 8°, which occurred on 18th January 1881,
the highest was 76°, on 16th July 1876. The temperature
of the ocean varies only about 13° during the year, from
41.6° in February, to 54.5° in August. The mean annual
rainfall of about 37 inches compares with over 80 inches
in many parts of the West Highlands, and with 23 inches
at Cromarty, the driest station in Scotland. The wettest
months are October, November, and December, during
which the Islands receive from one-third to one-half of
their annual rainfall, the driest months are April, May,
and June, which together receive only one-eighth of
the total fall. Thus Orkney is practically never troubled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>with excessive rainfall, and serious droughts are equally
unknown. The mean annual sunshine of 1185 hours
compares favourably with 1164 hours at Edinburgh.
London enjoys 1260 hours, Hastings 1780. Orkney’s
brightest month is May, with an average of 178 hours
of sunshine, the gloomiest is December with 20.6
hours.</p>

</div>

<p>Apart from the fact that Orkney enjoys the mildest
winter of any Scottish county, the chief difference
between the weather of the archipelago and that of
Scotland in general is perhaps the greater prevalence
of high winds in the Islands, which owing to the general
lowness of the land receive the full force of the North
Atlantic gales, and which moreover lie in the most
common track of the Atlantic cyclones, a circumstance
which leads to great variability of wind and weather.
Orkney has record of only one hurricane, on 17th
November, 1893, with a velocity of 96 miles. Several
winter gales of over 80 miles have been recorded, and
one summer gale of 75 miles in the year 1890. During
the fifteen years 1890-1904, 300 gales were recorded in
Orkney, practically the same as at Fleetwood in Lancashire,
while Alnwick experienced only 157, and Valentia
on the west coast of Ireland only 130. Atlantic cyclones
are the dominating factor in Orkney weather during
the greater portion of the year, producing gales of
greater or smaller magnitude, and being almost invariably
accompanied by rain, with sudden changes
both in the direction and the force of the wind. In the
spring season, however, anticyclones frequently cause
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>spells of dry, cold weather, with fairly steady winds
from the eastward or northward.</p>

<p>Winter in Orkney is in general a steady series of high
winds, heavy rains, and ever varying storms, with much
less frequent falls of snow, and fewer severe or continuous
frosts than elsewhere in Scotland. Under the shelter
of garden walls we have seen strawberry plants in
blossom at Christmas and roses in January, while chance
primroses may be found in sheltered nooks in any month
of the year. The spring is cold and late, but the prevailing
winds from N.W., N.E., or E. have not the
piercing coldness so often felt in the spring winds along
the east coast of Scotland. The summer is short, but
remarkable for rapidity of growth. Fogs are fairly
common during summer and early autumn, and come
on and disperse with exceptional suddenness. Thunder
in Orkney occurs mostly in winter, during high winds
and continuous falls of rain or snow. The heaviest
rains and the most prevalent and strongest winds are
from the S.W. and S.E.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left"> <a name="Section_9" id="Section_9"></a> 9. The People&mdash;Race, Language, Population</h2>


<p>It is unsafe to dogmatise on the early races of Orkney;
but from the undoubted community in blood, speech, and
culture with other northern counties of Scotland during
the Celtic period, we may fairly conjecture that the
Islands must have similarly shared in whatever pre-Celtic
population&mdash;Iberian or other&mdash;these regions as
a whole possessed.</p>

<p>Into the vexed question whether any remnant of
Celtic population survived the Norse settlement of
the Islands in the ninth century we cannot enter here.
It is certain that for centuries after that era Norse speech,
law, and custom were as universal and supreme in
Orkney as ever Anglo-Saxon speech and institutions
were in Kent or Norfolk. The place-names of the
Islands are, save for a late Scottish and English element,
entirely Norse.</p>

<p>The Scottish immigration into Orkney, which commenced
about 1230, came for centuries almost exclusively
from the Lowlands&mdash;the Lothians, Fife, Forfarshire,
and those parts of Stirlingshire, Perthshire,
Aberdeenshire, Banffshire, and Moray which lie outside
the “Highland Line,” being the chief areas drawn from.
A later and much slighter strain of immigration from
Caithness, Sutherland, and Ross, which affected the
South Isles more especially, was itself quite as much
of Norse as of Celtic ancestry. The people of Orkney
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>must therefore be put down as in the main an amalgam
of Norse and Lowland Scots.</p>

<p>There never was any very rigid line of division between
these two races in the Islands. So much is it the case
that, while the Norse were being Scotticised in speech
and custom, the incomers were at the same time being
Orcadianised in sentiment, that the opprobrious epithet
of “Ferry-loupers,” hurled by native Orcadians at
successive generations of Scots intruders, is itself of
Scottish origin. The <em>genius loci</em> was a very potent
spirit, and the Scoto-Orcadian was often prouder of
being an Orcadian than of being a Scot.</p>

<p>The humblest Orcadians have for centuries past spoken
English more correctly and naturally than was at all
common among the Scottish lower orders before the
advent of board school education, a circumstance largely
due to the fact that a great portion of the population
exchanged Norse speech for Scots about the period&mdash;the
later sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries&mdash;when
educated Scots were themselves adopting English. Add
to this the constant presence of passing English vessels
and the presence of Cromwell’s soldiers. At the same
time a modified Scots dialect is commonly spoken by
the less educated classes, but even in this the admixture
of pure English is pronounced. A few Norse words,
mostly nouns, survive imbedded in the local speech,
whether English or Scots. Norse speech lingered in
Harray until about 1750.</p>

<p>The population of Orkney, which numbered 24,445
in the year 1801, increased almost uninterruptedly to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>a maximum of 32,395 in 1861. Every subsequent census,
except that of 1881, has shown a decrease, and the
9.8 per cent. rate of intercensal decline recorded in
1911 was the heaviest revealed by the census of that
year for any Scottish county. The population in that
year was 25,897, being 69 to the square mile.</p>

<p>Under modern conditions Orkneymen have resumed
the roving instincts of their Norse ancestors, and the
variety of capacities under which the sons and daughters
of the Islands live in the far corners of the earth is
astonishing. The ostensible local causes of this movement
are in reality of secondary importance. The real
causes are improved education, improved communications,
and the grit to take advantage of them. Can
any Scottish or English county show the equivalent
of <cite>The Orkney and Shetland American</cite>, a little newspaper
published for years in Chicago? “A Shields
Shetlander,” too, is a current descriptive tag which
might well be supplemented by “A Leith Orcadian.”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left"><a name="Section_10" id="Section_10"></a> 10.  Agriculture</h2>


<p>Farming is the very life of Orkney, giving full or
partial employment to no less than 6400 of the population.
The great era of agriculture in the Islands
followed, and was partly the consequence of the failure
of the local kelp industry in the second quarter of the
nineteenth century. The area under crop and permanent
pasture rose from about 30,000 acres in 1855 to 86,949
acres in 1870. It is now 107,941 acres, while in addition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>at least 52,941 acres of heath and mountain land are
utilised for grazing. The chief crops are oats, 33,153
acres; turnips, 13,877 acres; and hay, 9425 acres.
Stock rearing is the cornerstone of Orcadian farming.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_038.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="438" />
<p class="captioncenter">Harvesting at Stenness</p>
</div>

<p>Short-horns and polled Angus are the favoured breeds
of cattle, and many thousand head from the Islands
pass through the Aberdeen auction marts every year.
The finest of the beef&mdash;and prime Orkney beef is second
to none&mdash;finally reaches Smithfield. Cheviots and
Cheviot-Leicester crosses are the common sheep, the
small native breed, of Norwegian origin, being now
confined to North Ronaldshay. The old Orkney horse,
itself probably a hybrid of half Norwegian and half
Scottish extraction, has for several generations past
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>been crossed with Clydesdale blood, and the resultant
is a small-sized but very sturdy and serviceable animal.
Oxen are still used to a small extent as draught animals.
The export of eggs and poultry is a great and growing
Orcadian industry, the annual output from the Islands
being at least £60,000 in value, a larger figure be it
noted than the purely agricultural rental of the county.
The fattening of geese for the Christmas market is a
special feature of Orkney poultry-farming, the birds
being largely brought from Shetland at the end of
harvest and put on the stubble. The open winter is
a valuable consideration to poultry-keepers in the
Islands, increasing the amount of natural food which
the birds are able to pick up, and extending the period
of laying.</p>

<p>Large quantities of sea-weed are available as manure
in practically every part of the Islands, and marl in
some localities. The chief disadvantages under which
agriculture labours in Orkney are distance from the
markets, and occasional damage to grain crops from
sea-gust. Agricultural co-operative societies, however,
which have obtained a firm footing in the Islands,
are doing a great deal to counter-act the effects of the
first-mentioned drawback.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left"><a name="Section_11" id="Section_11"></a> 11.  Industries and Manufactures</h2>


<p>The manufacture of kelp was introduced into the
Islands in 1722, and by 1826 the annual export amounted
to 3500 tons, valued at £24,500. The abolition of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>duty on barilla, which is largely used in the manufacture
of glass, destroyed this industry for a time; but since
about 1880 there has been a considerable revival in the
North Isles, the yearly export having again reached
about 1500 tons. Orkney kelp is considered of the
finest quality.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_040.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="374" />
<p class="captioncenter">Orkney Yawl Boats</p>
</div>

<p>The making of linen yarn and cloth, introduced in 1747,
was successfully carried on for many years, and flax
was locally grown. This industry received a severe
check during the Great War (1793-1815), and gradually
disappeared.</p>

<p>The manufacture of straw-plait for bonnets and hats
was begun about 1800, and fifteen years later the yearly
export was valued at £20,000, from 6000 to 7000 women
being employed in the industry. The material used
was at first split ripened wheat straw; later, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>unripened, unsplit, boiled and bleached rye-straw was
substituted. The reduction of the import duty on
straw-plait finally destroyed this interesting home
industry, of which Kirkwall and Stromness were the
chief centres.</p>

<p>The present-day industries of Orkney are unimportant.
No minerals are worked in the county, although flagstone
is quarried at Clestrain in Orphir, and red sandstone
of fine quality at Fersness in Eday. The numerous
sailing boats used in the Islands are mostly of home
construction, the broad-beamed, shallow-draught, and
comparatively light Orkney yawl being a type specially
designed to suit local conditions of weather and tide.
The making of the well-known Orkney straw-backed
chairs is restricted by a very limited demand, and the
specimens made for sale are somewhat more elaborate
than those used in the cottages. A small quantity of
home-spun tweed is made in the Islands, and a certain
amount of rough knitting&mdash;stockings, mittens, and other
articles used by the seafaring classes&mdash;is done in some
districts. Fish-curing is carried on at Kirkwall, and to
a small extent, as a home industry, in country districts.
There are distilleries at Stromness, Scapa, and Highland
Park, near Kirkwall, the output at the last-named
being large, and in high esteem among whisky-blenders.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left"><a name="Section_12" id="Section_12"></a> 12.  Fisheries and Fishing Station</h2>


<p>Of recent years Whitehall in Stronsay has become
one of the great centres of the summer herring fishing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>with an annual catch of from 80,000 to 90,000 crans,
a total exceeded in Scotland only at the ports of Lerwick,
Fraserburgh and Peterhead. As at many other places
where this great industry is carried on, however, the
boats, the capital, and the personnel come almost
entirely from outside. There are smaller stations of
this fishery at Kirkwall, Sanday, Stromness, Holm, and
Burray, at the last-named of which alone the boats
and crews are local.</p>

<p>The white fishing is carried on in a desultory fashion
in Orkney waters by some 350 fishermen, who use small
locally-made yawls, but the annual catch is not important
compared with that of other fishery districts.
Haddocks, cod, and saithe are the commonest fish.
Saithe simply swarm, but are caught chiefly for household
consumption. Some 250 other men who style
themselves “crofter-fishermen” in the census returns,
are in reality small farmers who do an occasional day’s
fishing, mainly for the pot. Lobster fishing is the one
branch of the industry which the “crofter-fishermen”
do follow with any persistence, and lobsters and other
shell-fish, mainly whelks, to the value of from £6000
to £7000, are exported from the Islands annually.
The whelks are gathered mainly by women. There are
338 fishing boats in Orkney, of an aggregate burden of
2154 tons, and of a value, including fishing gear, of
£16,095.</p>

<p>Sea-trout are plentiful along much of the Orkney
coast, especially near estuaries; but although surreptitious
netting is intermittently done by unauthorised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>persons, this fishing is not, as with proper care it might
be, on any sound commercial footing. Sea-trout run
to a large size in the Islands, fish of from 8 to 10 lbs.
being not uncommon. Walls, Hoy, the Bay of Ireland,
Holm, and Rousay are the best localities. The net
season is from 24th February to 10th September, the
rod season from the same opening date to 31st October.</p>

<p>Longhope and the Bay of Firth were of old famous
for oysters, and at the latter place a praiseworthy effort
was recently made to restore the fishery.</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left"><a name="Section_13" id="Section_13"></a> 13.  History of the County</h2>


<p>Our knowledge of the Orkney Islands before the
Norse settlement in the latter part of the ninth century
is of a slight and fragmentary character. In particular,
what Latin writers say gives no sure information, the
references in poets like Juvenal and Claudian being
manifestly for literary ornament.</p>

<p>The earliest writer of British race to throw any light
on the Islands is Adamnan, who mentions that in the
sixth century Cormac, a cleric of Iona, with certain
companions, visited the Orkneys, and adds that the
contemporary Pictish ruler of the Islands was a hostage
in the hands of Brude Mac Meilcon, King of the Northern
Picts. Whatever degree of power this Pictish king
may have exercised over the Islands, we learn from the
<cite>Annals of Ulster</cite> that in the year 580 they were invaded
by Aidan, King of the Dalriadic Scots, and as the next
mention of the Orkneys in the native chronicles is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>record of their devastation by the Pictish King Brude
Mac Bile in the year 682, it is perhaps a fair inference
that Dalriadic influence had predominated there during
the intervening century. That the Islands were
christianised about this period by clerics of the Columban
or Irish Church, is a point too firmly established by
archaeological, topographical, and other data to require
any insistence on here. Many pre-Norse church dedications
to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Columba, <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Ninian, and other Celtic
saints, tell their own story.</p>

<p>Little is known of the state of the Islands during two
centuries preceding the date of the Norse settlement
<i>c.</i> 872 <small>A.D.</small>, but from that era until the year 1222 Orkney
possesses in the <cite>Orkneyinga Saga</cite> a record of the highest
value. The <cite>Saga</cite> states that the Islands were settled
by the Norsemen in the days of Harald the Fair-haired
(Harfagri), but had previously been a base for Vikings.
Harald Harfagri had about the year 870 made himself
sole King of Norway, and in so doing had incurred the
odium of a large section of the Odallers, or landowners,
many of whom in consequence emigrated to Iceland,
Shetland, Orkney, the Hebrides, and the coasts of
Ireland. The settlers in Orkney, Shetland, and the
Western Islands took to piracy, and so inflicted the
coasts of old Norway, that in 872 Harald followed up
the fugitives, conquered all the islands of the Scottish
seas, and placed his partisan Rognvald, Earl of Moeri,
as hereditary Jarl over Orkney and Shetland. This
nobleman, however, preferring to live in Norway, gifted
his western jarldom to his brother Sigurd, who is com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>monly
considered the first, as he proved one of the
greatest, of the long line of Orcadian Jarls. Sigurd
speedily spread his power over northern Scotland as far
south as Moray, and from his time until the close of the
thirteenth century the Orkney Jarls had the controlling
hand in Caithness, Sutherland, and Easter Ross. Jarl
Sigurd died in 875, and was ultimately succeeded by
the scarcely less strenuous Torf-Einar, a son of Jarl
Rognvald, and a half-brother of Hrolf (Rollo), the
conqueror of Normandy. Einar got his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</i> of
“Torf” from the fact of his having learned in Scotland,
and taught the islanders, the practice of cutting turf
for fuel. He was succeeded by three sons, of whom
the two elder, Arnkell and Erlend, fell in the battle of
Stanesmoor in England, in 950. The third, Thorfinn
Hausacliuf (Skull-Splitter), proved as good as his name,
and well maintained the doughty reputation of a family
which later, in a collateral line, produced William the
Conqueror.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_046.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="423" />
<p class="captioncenter">Kirkwall</p>
</div>

<p>Let us pause here, however, to outline the polity and
state of society which had now become established in
the Islands. The Orkney Jarls were not autocratic
rulers. The Odallers, assembled at the <em>Thing</em>, made
the laws, on the advice or with the concurrence of the
Jarls, but these laws were superimposed on a body of
old Norse oral laws which the settlers had brought with
them from over-sea. The land law taking no account
of primogeniture, the sons of an Odaller succeeded
equally to his estate, and a daughter could claim half
the share of a son. The eldest son, however, could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>claim possession of the Bu (English <i>by</i>, as in Whitby),
or chief dwelling. An Odaller could not divest himself
of his odal heritage, except for debt, or in security
for a debt, and in such a case a right of redemption
lay for all time, not only with his nearest heir, direct
or collateral, but on refusal of nearer heirs to avail
themselves of it, with any descendant whatsoever.
Under such a system free men without landed interest
actual or prospective were few, and the odal-born
formed the bulk of the population. Some of the
wealthier Odallers, however, possessed a limited number
of thralls, and thraldom was hereditary. Land tax,
or <em>scat</em>, was paid by the Odallers to the Jarl, and by the
Jarl to the King, but in both cases the payment was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>a fiscal imposition rather than a feudal exaction, the
Crown of Norway recognising the obligation of defending
the Islands against outside foes in final resort. Apart
from this, the overlordship of the mother-country was
so slight that in the European diplomacy of the times
the Jarls were treated as sovereign princes.</p>

<p>Thorfinn Hausacliuf died <i>c.</i> 963; and the rule of his
five sons, Havard, Hlodver, Ljot, Skuli, and Arnfinn
is noticeable for the first of those family feuds which
form so marked a feature of the history of the Jarls.
Skuli took the title of Earl of Caithness from the King
of Scots, and fared against Ljot with a host provided
by the King and the Scots Earl Macbeth. Ljot defeated
him in the Dales of Caithness, Skuli being slain.
Earl Macbeth with a second host, was in turn defeated
by Ljot at Skidmoor (Skitton) in Caithness, and here
Ljot fell. His other brothers having already disappeared
in domestic strife, Hlodver was now left sole. He
married Edna, an Irish princess, and their only son
Sigurd Hlodverson, the Stout, is one of the most famous
characters of the <cite>Saga</cite>. Succeeding his father in 980,
Sigurd held Caithness by main force against the Scots.
A Scots maormor, Finnleik, the father of the celebrated
Macbeth, having challenged him to a pitched battle at
Skidmoor by a fixed day, Sigurd took counsel of his
mother, for she, as the <cite>Saga</cite> says, “knew many things,”
that is, by witchcraft. Edna made her son a banner
“woven with mighty spells,” which would bring victory
to those before whom it was borne, but death to the
bearer. Armed with this uncanny device, Sigurd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>defeated his challenger at Skidmoor, with the loss of
three standard-bearers. An incident of wider consequence,
however, befell Sigurd in the year 995. Olaf
Tryggvi’s son, King of Norway, came on the Jarl aboard
ship in a small bay in the South Isles. The King had
the superior force, and, a recent convert himself, he
there and then forced christianity upon the reluctant
Jarl, and laid him under an obligation to impose the
faith upon the people of Orkney. The <cite>Saga</cite> adds, “then
all the Orkneys became christian,” and so indeed the
Islands henceforth remained. Sigurd himself, however,
reverted to the old gods, and in the year 1014,
he joined the great Norse expedition against Brian,
King of Ireland, which led to the battle of Clontarf.
In that famous fight the Skidmoor banner again did
service, but the spell was broken. “Hrafn the Red,”
called out the Jarl after two standard-bearers had fallen,
and an Icelander who knew its fatal secret had declined
to touch it, “bear thou the banner.” “Bear thine own
devil thyself,” rejoined Hrafn. Then the Earl said,
“’Tis fittest that the beggar should bear the bag,” at
the same time taking the banner from the staff and
placing it under his cloak. A little after, the Earl was
pierced through with a spear.</p>

<p>Most famous of all the Jarls in the eyes of the Norse
was Thorfinn the Great, Sigurd’s son by a second
marriage with a daughter of Malcolm <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, King of Scots.
Sigurd, however, was at first succeeded in Orkney by
Brusi, Somerled, and Einar, sons of an earlier marriage,
while Thorfinn, a boy of five, who had been fostered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>by the Scots King, was invested by his grandfather in
the Earldom of Caithness and Sutherland. On attaining
manhood, however, Thorfinn made good his claim to
a share of Orkney also, and after many vicissitudes of
fighting and friendship with his half-brothers, and with
Jarl Rognvald <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, Brusi’s son, was finally left sole ruler
there. He extended his power far and wide over northern
Scotland, controlled the Hebrides, and ruled certain
parts of Ireland. He even invaded England in the
absence of King Hardicanute, and, according to the
<cite>Saga</cite>, defeated in two pitched battles the forces that
opposed him. In later life Thorfinn visited Rome,
and he built a minster, known as Christchurch, in
Birsay, the first seat of the Bishopric of Orkney. He
died in 1064. Thorfinn’s sons Paul and Erlend succeeded,
and two years later shared the defeat of their
suzerain King Harald Sigurdson (Hardradi) at Stamford
Bridge. Returning home by grace of Harold Godwinson,
the Jarls ruled in peace for some years. As their sons
grew up, however, Hakon, Paul’s son, quarrelled with
his cousins Erling and Magnus (the future saint), Erlend’s
sons, and matters grew so unquiet that in 1098 King
Magnus Barelegs sent the two Jarls prisoners to Norway,
and placed his own son Sigurd over the Jarldom. On
the death of King Magnus in 1106, Sigurd returned to
Norway to share the vacant throne with his brothers,
and the overlords restored Hakon, Paul’s son, and Magnus,
Erlend’s son, to the Jarldom. Quarrels were renewed,
with the final result that in the year 1116 Magnus was
murdered in the island of Egilsey, where the cousins had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>met to discuss their differences, by the followers of
Jarl Hakon, Hakon himself more than consenting.
The fame of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Magnus soon spread over the whole
Scandinavian world, and at an early date a church was
dedicated to him even in London. Jarl Hakon, after
the manner of the times, made an expiatory journey to
Rome and the Holy Land, and thereafter ruled Orkney
with great acceptance until his death in 1126. He was
succeeded by his son Paul. While in Orkney in 1098,
however, King Magnus Barelegs had married Gunnhilda,
a daughter of Jarl Erlend, to a Norwegian
gentleman named Kol. To their son Kali, Sigurd
King of Norway now granted a half share of the
Islands, with the title of Jarl, and from a fancied resemblance
to Jarl Rognvald <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, insisted on changing
his name to Rognvald. The royal grant being strenuously
opposed by Jarl Paul, Rognvald vowed that if
he succeeded in making good his claim, he would erect
a stone minster at Kirkwall, and dedicate it to his
sainted uncle, Jarl Magnus. After many vicissitudes
by sea and land, Rognvald finally proved successful,
and how he fulfilled his vow the Cathedral Church of
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Magnus still shows. <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Rognvald&mdash;for in 1192 he
too was canonised&mdash;was at once the most genial and
the most accomplished of the Jarls, and one of the
great characters of the <cite>Orkney Saga</cite>. He made a famous
voyage to Palestine (1152-1155), fighting, love-making,
and poetising by the way. Incidental to his great
struggle for power with <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Rognvald, Jarl Paul had
in 1137 been seized by the famous viking Swein Asleifson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>and carried off to Athole, where he was placed in the
hands of Maddad, Earl of Athole, who had married his
half-sister Margaret. The whole affair is shrouded by
mystery, but Countess Margaret appears to have intrigued
both with her brother and with Jarl Rognvald
to have her son Harald, a boy of three, conjoined with
Rognvald in the Jarldom. In the sequel Jarl Paul
mysteriously disappears, murdered, according to one
account, at the instigation of the Countess; and in
1139 Jarl Rognvald accepted the young Harald Maddadson
as his partner. With occasional intervals of
friction this somewhat oddly assorted pair ruled together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>until 1159, when the checkered career of the genial
and many-sided <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Rognvald was closed by his assassination
in a personal quarrel in Caithness. Thereafter
Harald ruled the Islands alone until his death in 1206.
A powerful and overbearing man, he quarrelled with
John, Bishop of Caithness, blinded the prelate and
caused his tongue to be cut out; barbarities which
brought King William the Lyon to the borders of Caithness
with an army (1202). Harald bought off the King,
and on the whole maintained his own in Caithness,
although all the circumstances of the times show that
a now feudalised Scotland is becoming increasingly able
to reassert its authority in these northern parts. Harald
got into difficulties with his Norwegian suzerain, King
Sverrir, who deprived him of Shetland, which was not
again conjoined with Orkney until two centuries later.
Harald was succeeded by two sons, David and John,
the former of whom died in 1214. Jarl John, like his
father, came into conflict with the Church and with
Scotland. Adam, Bishop of Caithness, successor to the
mutilated Bishop John, having proved too exacting in
the collection of Church dues, the laity appealed to the
Jarl, who, however, declined to intervene. Whereupon
the outraged laymen burnt the Bishop in a house into
which they had thrust him. King Alexander <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, came
with an army, and not only heavily fined the Jarl,
but also had the hands and feet hewn off eighty men
who had been present at the Bishop’s death. Jarl John
was slain in a brawl at Thurso in 1231, and, as he left
no son, the line of the Norse Jarls of Orkney ended.</p>

<p>King Alexander <abbr title="2">II</abbr> of Scotland granted the Earldom
of Caithness, now finally disjoined from Sutherland,
to Magnus, second son of Gilbride Earl of Angus, whose
wife was a daughter or sister of the late Jarl, and Magnus
was also recognised as Earl of Orkney by the King of
Norway. The old Jarls had been Norse nobles who
held the northern shires of Scotland more or less in
defiance of the Scottish Crown, the future Earls of
Orkney are great Scottish nobles holding a fief of the
Crown of Norway. In consequence, an influx of Scots
into the Islands now commenced, which, accelerated
by their cession to Scotland in 1468, in the end was
the means of transforming the Orcadians into a British
community. The history of this Scoto-Norse period
is obscure, the Icelandic records largely failing us, but
the law of primogeniture being now tacitly applied
to the succession, Earl Magnus was followed by two
Earls of the name of Gilbride, and the second Gilbride
by another Magnus. The latter is mentioned in the
<cite>Saga</cite> of King Hakon Hakonson, of Largs fame, as
having accompanied the King on that expedition,
after which the monarch came back to Orkney with
his storm-shattered fleet, and died in the Bishop’s
palace at Kirkwall on 15th December, 1263. By the
treaty of Perth in 1266 Hakon’s successor, Magnus the
Seventh, ceded to the Scottish Crown all the islands
of the Scottish seas, except the Orkneys and Shetland,
for an annual payment of 100 merks, to be paid into the
hands of the Bishop of Orkney, within the church of
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Magnus. Earl Magnus died in 1273, and was suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>cessively
followed by his sons Magnus and John,
the latter of whom, as Earl of Caithness, swore fealty
to Edward <abbr title="1">I</abbr> of England in 1297. In 1320, however,
John’s son and successor Magnus subscribed, as Earl
of Caithness and Orkney, the letter to the Pope in which
the Scottish nobles asserted the independence of Scotland.
This Magnus was the last of the Angus line of Earls,
and was succeeded in 1321 by Malise, Earl of Stratherne,
who is supposed to have married his daughter. Malise
fell at Halidon Hill in 1333, and his son of the same
name succeeded to the three Earldoms of Stratherne,
Caithness, and Orkney. Malise <abbr title="2">II</abbr> died <i>c.</i> 1350, leaving
only daughters, and after an unsettled period of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>conflicting claims to the succession, Hakon King of
Norway in 1379 finally invested Henry <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clair of
Roslin, grandson of Earl Malise <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, and son-in-law of
Malise <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, not only in the Earldom of Orkney, but in
the Lordship of Shetland also. Earl Henry made
himself practically independent of Norway, and built a
castle at Kirkwall in defiance of the Norwegian Crown.
He was succeeded in 1400 by his son Henry, whose active
and interesting career as Lord High Admiral belongs
to the history of Scotland. The Earls of the Sinclair
family lived with considerable state, styling themselves
Princes of Orkney, and their rule was on the whole
popular and fortunate; but little of outside interest
took place in the Islands at this period. Scottish
customs, however, and traces of Scottish feudal law were
slowly encroaching on the old Norse system. Earl
Henry <abbr title="2">II</abbr>’s son William was the last Earl of Orkney
under Scandinavian rule. By the Union of Calmar
in 1397 the suzerainty of the Islands had already passed,
with the crown of Norway, to the Kings of Denmark.
In the years 1460-61 a series of raids were&mdash;not for the
first time&mdash;made on Orkney by sea-rovers from the
Hebrides, and Christian <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, King of Denmark, Sweden,
and Norway, failing to obtain redress from the Scottish
Crown for this and other grievances, demanded the
long arrears of the annual tribute payable by Scotland
in respect of the Hebrides, in terms of the treaty of
1266. Charles <abbr title="8">VIII</abbr> of France having been called in
as arbitrator, a somewhat ugly contretemps was happily
adjusted by the marriage of Christian’s daughter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>Margaret to the young King James <abbr title="3">III</abbr> of Scotland,
and by the terms of the marriage-contract the Danish
monarch not only relinquished the quit-rent for the
Hebrides, but agreed to pay down a dowry of 60,000
florins. As Christian was able to find only 2000 florins
of this money at the time, the Orkneys and Shetland
were given in pawn to the Scottish Crown until the
balance should be paid, the agreement expressly stipulating
for the maintenance of Norse law in the Islands
meantime. This happened in 1468, and a few years
later King James negotiated the surrender by Earl
William <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Clair of all his rights in the Islands; whereupon
by Act of the Scottish Parliament the Earldom
of Orkney and Lordship of Shetland were in 1471
annexed to the Scottish Crown, “nocht to be gevin
away in time to cum to na persain or persains excep
alenarily to ane of ye Kingis sonis of lauchful bed,” a
proviso which went by the board.</p>

<p>The long and painful story of Scottish oppression
in Orkney and Shetland has a literature of its own,
and can only be briefly referred to here. The Scottish
Crown from the first treated the <em>scats</em>, in origin and
essence a public tax, as a sort of personal perquisite
of the King, or part of the Royal patrimonium, and
farmed them out, along with the Earldom lands, to one
needy favourite or importunate creditor after another,
Orkney at the same time being now made liable to all
Scottish taxation. Many of these grantees received
the jurisdiction of Sheriff, a circumstance which led
to the accelerated encroachment of Scottish feudal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>law on the old Norse legal system. Mere treaty stipulation
proved a frail protection to the oppressed Odallers,
when the only appeal against strained laws and unjust
exactions lay to the Scottish Crown itself, which had
installed the oppressors, and whose ministers and judges
knew and cared nothing about Odal law. Twice indeed,
first in 1503, and again in 1567, the Scottish Parliament
expressly recognised the obligation to maintain Norse
law, pious or perfunctory opinions which had no practical
effect. The two most notorious, because the most
powerful, of these Scottish oppressors of Orkney and
Shetland were Lord Robert Stewart, whose half-sister,
Queen Mary, in 1564 granted him the Sheriffship of
both groups, together with all the Crown rights and
possessions therein, and Lord Robert’s son Patrick.
In 1581 Lord Robert was further created Earl of Orkney
by his nephew King James <abbr title="6">VI</abbr>, and Patrick succeeded
him in 1591. Rents and scats being payable to a large
extent in kind, by tampering with the old Norse weights
and measures, these two harpies in a few years actually
increased their revenues from the Earldom one-half.
Owing to the unceasing complaints of all classes of the
community Earl Patrick was finally imprisoned, and
in 1615 executed for high treason. As it had now
become apparent that the holders of the Earldom rights
had all along simply utilised the local courts and forms
of legal procedure for their private advantage, by an
Act of the “Lordis of Secret Council,” of date 22nd
March, 1611, all foreign (<i>i.e.</i> Norse) laws theretofore
in use in Orkney and Shetland were discharged, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>all magistrates in those islands were enjoined to use
only “the proper laws of this kingdom.” Although
this Act was of doubtful validity on more grounds than
one, yet it has held good; and apart from the maintenance
of Norse law in its integrity, an ideal
which the conditions of the times rendered unattainable,
the change was probably the best thing that could
have happened for the Islands.</p>

<p>Although the fact had only a transient bearing on
the history of the Islands, we must not fail to record
that Queen Mary, on her marriage with Bothwell, in
1567, created him Duke of Orkney. After the Queen’s
defeat at Carberry, Bothwell fled to the Islands, to be
repulsed from Kirkwall Castle by the governor. Thence
he proceeded northwards to play the pirate in Shetland,
and finally to find imprisonment and death in Scandinavia.
In the year 1633 the Earldom lands and rights
were granted by the Crown to the Earls of Morton,
one of whom sold them in 1766 to Sir Lawrence Dundas,
with whose descendants, now represented by the Marquis
of Zetland, they still remain.</p>

<p>Montrose on his way to invade Scotland in 1650,
first landed in Orkney, and the major part of the
force with which he met his final defeat at Carbisdale
was recruited in the Islands. Under the Commonwealth
Cromwell maintained a garrison at Kirkwall,
and the Islanders are said to have picked up improved
methods of gardening and other domestic amenities
from the Ironsides. In the following century the vexed
question of Stewart <em>versus</em> Guelph brought Orkney
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>its own share of commotion, but the details are, from
an historical point of view, of purely local interest.</p>

<p>Of vastly wider import has been the latest appearance
of the islands in the arena of history. In that
great contest, the sound and fury of which has barely
subsided as we write, the Royal Navy found in Scapa
Flow an ideal base for the conduct of its widely-spreading
operations. And if, as many skilful observers appear
to hold, successful strategy at sea proved the slowly-working
but inevitably certain cause of the final defeat
of the foe, it is not too much to say that for four eventful
years the little Archipelago, whose “rough island
story” we have here told in outline, stood forth as the
pivot of the world’s history and of its fate.</p>

<p>The dramatic death of the great Earl Kitchener in
Orcadian waters, in June 1916, further riveted the attention
of the modern world on a region which to its
own sons has never ceased to be the haunted home of
Harald the Fair-haired, Olaf Tryggvi’s son, and other
sea-kings of old.</p>

<p>The Orkney Islands offer an especially fertile field
to the archaeologist. The sites of a least 70 brochs
have been located in the group, as against 75 in Shetland,
79 in Caithness, 60 in Sutherland, and some 70 in the
northern Hebrides. These districts constitute the
main area of the brochs, which rapidly decrease in
number as one proceeds southwards, Forfarshire offering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>but two specimens, and Perthshire, Stirlingshire, and
Berwickshire one each.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_060.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="480" />
<p class="captioncenter">Ground Plan of Broch of Lingrow, near Kirkwall</p>
</div>

<p>“The typical form of the broch,” says Dr Anderson,
“is that of a hollow circular tower of dry-built masonry,
about 60 feet in diameter and about 50 feet high. Its
wall, which is about 15 feet thick, is carried up solid
for about 8 feet, except where two or three oblong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>chambers, with rudely-vaulted roofs, are constructed
in its thickness. Above the height of about 8 feet, the
wall is carried up with a hollow space of about 3 feet
wide between its exterior and interior shell. This hollow
space at about the height of a man, is crossed horizontally
by a roof of slabs, the upper surfaces of which form
the floor of the space above. This is repeated at every
5 or 6 feet of its farther height. These spaces thus
form horizontal galleries, separated from each other
vertically by the slabs of their floors and roofs. The
galleries run completely round the tower, except that
they are crossed by the stair, so that each gallery opens
in front of the steps, and its farther end is closed by the
back of the staircase on the same level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“The only opening in the outside of the tower is the
main entrance, a narrow, tunnel-like passage 15 feet
long, 5 to 6 feet in height, and rarely more than 3 feet
in width, leading straight through the wall on the ground
level, and often flanked on either side by guard-chambers
opening into it. This gives access to the central area
or courtyard of the tower, round the inner circumference
of which, in different positions, are placed the entrances
to the chambers on the ground-floor, and to the staircase
leading to the galleries above. In its external aspect,
the tower is a truncated cone of solid masonry, unpierced
by any opening save the narrow doorway; while
the central court presents the aspect of a circular well
30 feet in diameter bounded by a perpendicular wall
50 feet high, and presenting at intervals on the ground
floor several low and narrow doorways, giving access
to the chambers and stair, and above these ranges
of small window-like openings rising perpendicularly
over each other to admit light and air to the
galleries.”</p>

<p>In some respects the most interesting broch site in
Orkney is that at Lingrow, about two miles S.S.E. of
Kirkwall. Contiguous to this building lies a perfect
labyrinth of building of secondary occupation. A coin
of Vespasian and two of Antoninus were found at
Lingrow when the site was excavated in 1870. Another
interesting specimen is that at Hoxa in South Ronaldshay.
The little that remains of this building is situated on
the west side of a small bight which opens northwards
on Scapa Flow, and on the east side of the bight stands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>the site of a second broch. The two brochs together
command both the bight itself and a narrow isthmus
of land which connects it with Widewall Bay to the
southward. Defence of the land passage between
the two areas of water was obviously a prime motive
of construction in this case. Other interesting specimens
of brochs are at Okstro in Birsay, at Burgar in Evie,
and at Burrian in North Ronaldshay; but many of the
Orkney sites remain as yet unexcavated, or only tentatively
explored. Stone hand-mills (querns), stone
whorls and bone combs, both used in woollen weaving,
stone lamps, imitated from Roman models, hair combs,
and fragments of pottery are some of the articles found
in the Orkney brochs, none of which now show more
than a few feet of their original height.</p>

<p>A consideration of the geographical position of the
main area of their distribution leaves one with little
doubt that they were erected as the best and most
economical means that a scanty and scattered population
could devise to check continuous piratical incursions,
probably directed from Scandinavia and the coastal
regions of north-western Europe; but the exact era
of their erection is a question that still awaits definite
solution. One may safely conjecture, however, that
they were gradually destroyed by the incursions which
they were built to withstand.</p>

<p>Other primitive dwellings, of somewhat wider distribution
in Orkney than the brochs, are the “Picts’
houses,” either in the form of chambered mounds, such
as the widely-known Maeshowe, or of underground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>chambers of the type commonly known as weems.
Maeshowe (the Maidens’ Mound) is situated in the
parish of Stenness, near the high road from Kirkwall
to Stromness, and its external appearance is that of
a truncated cone 92 feet in diameter, 36 feet high, and
about 100 yards in circumference at the base. The
central chamber is reached by a straight passage 54
feet long, from 2 feet 4 inches to 3 feet 4 inches wide,
and from 2 feet 4 inches to 4 feet 8 inches high. The
chamber is 15 feet square on the floor, and 13 feet high,
the roof being formed by the stones, at the height of
6 feet from the floor, gradually overlapping. The four
angles of the chamber are supported by heavy stone
buttresses from 8 to 10 feet high, and about 3 feet square
at the base. Off the main chamber on the three sides
other than that which contains the entrance, are subsidiary
cells, the entrances to which are at a height of
3 feet from the floor. The walls of the central chamber
are scored with Norse runes some of which tell that the
place, which was known to the Norsemen as <i lang="nn" xml:lang="nn">Orkahaug</i>,
or the Muckle Mound, was broken into by the Jorsala-farers,
or pilgrims who accompanied <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Rognvald to
Jerusalem (Norse, <em>Jorsalaheim</em>) in 1152. Other stones
show pictorial designs, several being of fine workmanship.
Nothing is known of the date or origin of Maeshowe,
which from its elaborate design and peculiarities of
detail constitutes a thing unique among the antiquities
of Britain. Among weems, or eirde houses, as they
are sometimes called, which are irregularly-shaped
chambers excavated below the ordinary level of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>ground, perhaps the finest Orcadian example is that
at Saveroch, near Kirkwall.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p class="captioncenter">Incised Dragon, from Maeshowe</p>

<p>At a distance of about a mile and a half west and
south-west of Maeshowe is the remarkable series of
megalithic monuments collectively known as the Standing
Stones of Stenness. The “Ring of Brogar” is
the largest and most
complete; thirteen of its
stones are still standing,
while the stumps of
thirteen more are still <em>in
situ</em>, and ten are lying
prostrate. The highest
stone stands about 14
feet above ground, and
the total number of
stones is calculated to
have originally been sixty.
This circle has a diameter
of 366 feet, and encloses
2½ acres. Of the “Ring
of Stenness” proper, which has a diameter of 104 feet,
only two stones remain erect, but one of these is 17 feet
4 inches high, while another lying prostrate measures
19 feet × 5 feet × 1 ft. 8 inches, and has been calculated
to weigh 10.71 tons.</p>

<p>In a valley in Hoy, between the Ward Hill and the
precipitous ridge known as the Dwarfie Hammers,
lies the celebrated Dwarfie Stone, most puzzling perhaps
of all the antiquities of the Islands. This is a huge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>block of sandstone measuring about 28 feet in length,
and varying in breadth from 11 to 14½ feet. Its height
falls from 6½ feet at the southern to 2
feet at the northern end. On the west
side of the stone is an entrance giving
access to two couches or berths, the
southern and larger of which has a
stone pillow. When first mentioned
in writing by Jo Ben in his
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Descriptio Insularum Orchadiarum</i>,
in 1529, the Dwarfie Stone was as
great a puzzle as it is to-day, and
no suggested explanation of its origin
or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’être</i> appears to carry
much probability.</p>

founded by <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Rognvald in 1137 in memory of his uncle,
is, except that of Glasgow, the only mediaeval cathedral
in Scotland that remains complete in all its parts,
and, in the words of the Danish historian Worsae, it
constitutes incontestably the finest monument of their
dominion that the Scandinavians have left in Scotland.</p>

<p class="captioncenter"><abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Magnus’ Cathedral</p>
    <p class="captioncenter">View from N. Transept looking towards Choir</p>
</div>

<p>The church is a cruciform building, comprising nave
and nave aisles, choir and choir aisles, north and south
transepts, with a chapel off each transept to the east,
and a central tower. The interior length of nave and
choir is 217 feet 10 inches, exterior length 234½ feet;
interior width of choir and aisles at the east end 47
feet 5½ inches; interior width across the transepts
89½ feet; height to vaulting 71 feet; height from
floor under central tower to top of weather-cock 133 feet
4 inches. The stones used include two shades of red
sandstone, one lilac, one yellow, and one veiny red
and yellow, all brought from various parts of Orkney.
Sir Henry Dryden professes to trace five distinct styles
of architecture in the building, which he dates: 1137-1160,
1160-1200, 1200-1250, 1250-1350, and 1450-1500.
All that is beyond conjecture as to the eras of erection,
however, is that after <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Rognvald’s death, in 1159,
the building proceeded under the care of Bishop William
the Old, until his death in 1168. Part at least of the
church was consecrated before 1155, and received the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>remains of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Magnus, transferred from Christchurch
in Birsay. The general impress of the building is
severely Norman.</p>

<p>A conspicuous feature of the church is its great <em>apparent</em>
size, an effect deliberately produced by a skilful
adjustment of proportions, especially by the great
relative height, the restricted width, and the spacing
of the piers both in nave and choir. Specially fine
features of the building are the beautiful east window,
and the exquisitely carved doorways in the south
transept and west front. These doorways, says Sir
Henry, “are probably the finest examples in Great
Britain of the use of two stones of different colours in
patterns.” Unfortunately much of this beautiful particoloured
work is badly weathered.</p>

<p>The church is at present undergoing “restoration”
at the hands of the town council of Kirkwall, who own
the fabric, in fulfilment of a bequest by the late George
Hunter Thoms, Sheriff of Orkney.</p>

<p>On the highest point of the little island of Egilshay
stands a very interesting church, which has been the
subject of much archaeological conjecture since its
general style appears to combine early Celtic and Norse
elements, while it possesses one of those Irish Round
Towers the only other Scottish examples of which are
at Brechin and Abernethy. Apart from the tower,
the church consists of nave and chancel, the nave measuring
30 feet by 15½ feet, and the chancel, which is vaulted,
15 feet by 9½ feet. The tower is now 48 feet high and
unroofed, but is said to have been lessened by 15 feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>many years ago. An old print shows both church and
tower with slate roofs, that of the tower being the conical
cap typical of the Irish Round Towers. The church
was used for service down to the early part of last
century.</p>

<p>Dryden’s conjecture that the church of Egilshay was
built by Norsemen after the Irish model shortly after
the reconversion of the Islands to Christianity <i>c.</i> 998
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span><small>A.D.</small>, is a view which presents no anomalies either architectural
or historical, when we consider that at that
date many early Celtic churches must have survived
in Orkney, and that, in any case, the close connection
between Norse Orkney and the Scandinavian colonies
in Ireland would give Orcadians ready access to Irish
models. The alleged dedication of this church to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr>
Magnus rests on the late and doubtful authority of
Jo Ben (1529), but it was no doubt popularly
associated with the Saint’s name because, as the
<cite>Orkneyinga Saga</cite> tells, he entered it to pay his
devotions on the day of his murder.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="captioncenter">Apse of ancient Round Church, in Orphir</p>
</div>

<p>In the parish of Orphir, contiguous to the present
parish church, stands the only example in Scotland
of a circular church, built in imitation of the church of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. All that remains of
this interesting building, however, is the semicircular
chancel, which is 7 feet 2 inches wide and 7 feet 9 inches
deep, and about 9 feet of the circular nave on either
side. From the curvature of the remaining portion, the
diameter of the nave must have been from 18 to 19 feet.
Dryden conjectures that the side walls of the nave may
have been 15 feet or more in height, and that they were
surmounted by a conical roof. This church was almost
to a certainty erected by Jarl Hakon, the murderer of
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Magnus, after his return from his expiatory pilgrimage
to the Holy Land <i>c.</i> 1120.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left"> <a name="Section_16" id="Section_16"></a> 16. Architecture&mdash;(<i>b</i>) Castellated</h2>


<p>The early Norsemen in Orkney built their houses of wood
imported from Norway, with only a slight foundation
of stone; and the Norse theory of defence lay in attacking
the foe, preferably on sea. Save, therefore, for a few
buildings erected by Jarl or Bishop, and by one or two
powerful Viking chiefs, stone masonry during the purely
Norse period (870-1231) was practically confined to
churches. Even during the Scoto-Norse (1231-1468) and
Scottish periods men of sufficient power and wealth to
erect imposing buildings of stone were still few. Compared,
therefore, with an ordinary Scottish county the
castellated architecture of the Islands is meagre in
quantity; but several of the buildings of this class that
remain are of exceptional interest and beauty.</p>

<p class="captioncenter">The Staircase, Noltland Castle</p>
</div>

<p>At the north end of the island of Westray stands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>Noltland Castle, the only ancient military structure
which Orkney can now show in a state of comparative
preservation. The castle is clearly of two periods, but
the best authorities now reject the once prevalent idea
that the earlier portion could have been erected by
Thomas de Tulloch, Bishop of Orkney from 1418 to
1460. The building is supposed to have been added
to and beautified by a later Bishop, Edward Stewart,
yet so late as 1529 Jo Ben described it as “Arx
excellentissima sed nondum completa.” Adam Bothwell,
the first protestant Bishop, feued the castle to
Sir Gilbert Balfour, Master of the Household to Queen
Mary, and a doubtful tradition says that Balfour had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>orders to prepare the place as a retreat for the Queen
and Bothwell. Finally the place gave refuge to some
officers flying from Montrose’s defeat at Carbisdale, and
was on that account fired and left dismantled by Cromwell’s
soldiers. The great staircase of Noltland is one
of the finest in Scotland, excelled only by those of Fyvie
and Glamis Castles. Another special feature of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>castle is the exceptional number of shot-holes, splayed
both outwards and inwards, which give its exterior walls
the appearance of the hull of an old style man-of-war.</p>

<p>The Earl’s Palace at Kirkwall, built by Patrick
Stewart, Earl of Orkney, about 1600, is one of the most
beautiful specimens of domestic architecture in Scotland,
and more regal in appearance than anything north of
Stirling and Linlithgow. Fronting west, the building
forms three sides of a square, and is practically entire
save for the roof. On the ground floor is the grand hall,
a magnificent apartment about 55 feet long by 20 feet
wide, lighted by three splendid oriels, and a triple
window in the gable, divided and subdivided by mullions
and transoms. There are two fireplaces in the room,
one being 18 feet wide. At the landing of the main stair
there is a beautifully arched apartment of about 9 feet
long by 7½ feet wide, commonly styled the chapel, but
which may have been a waiting room. “It is a superb
specimen of Scottish seventeenth-century architecture,
its oriel windows and turrets being unsurpassed by anything
on the mainland, and it is so rich in its details,
and spacious in its accommodation, that it is with more
than usual regret that one looks on its roofless and
decaying walls.” The palace has not been inhabited
since towards the close of the seventeenth century.</p>

</div>

<p>The Bishop’s Palace at Kirkwall, which stands in
close proximity to the Earl’s Palace and the cathedral,
is supposed to have been erected by Bishop Reid (1540-1558),
on the site of an earlier building, in which King
Hakon Hakonson died in 1263. A prominent feature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>of this building is its great length, originally about 196
feet, from which it is supposed that it formed, or was
intended to form, one side of a quadrangle. Above
what was originally the main entrance is the corbelling
of a fine ruined oriel. There is a five-storeyed round
tower at the north-west corner of the building, which
contains in a niche of its exterior wall a statuette long
erroneously believed to represent Bishop Reid. The
chief apartment of the palace appears to have been
about 26½ feet long by 24 feet wide. Part of the structure
is still occupied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Overlooking the sea, in the extreme north-west of
the Mainland, stand the ruins of the Palace of Birsay,
erected by Robert Stewart, Earl of Orkney, about 1580,
on the site of an old palace of the Norse Jarls. Less
elaborate in design, and in a worse state of preservation
than the building erected by his son, Earl Robert’s palace
is sufficiently commodious and noble of outline to make
one marvel at the passionate taste for fine buildings
of a race which required two such imposing structures
in two successive generations. Earl Patrick is said to
have partly reconstructed his father’s building, modelling
his alterations on Holyrood, but the building as it
stands more resembles the later courtyard at Dunottar
Castle.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left"> <a name="Section_17" id="Section_17"></a> 17. Architecture&mdash;(<i>c</i>) Municipal and Domestic</h2>


<p>Kirkwall Municipal Buildings, a handsome three-storeyed
structure in the Scottish style, erected in 1884,
forms the one specimen of municipal architecture in the
county that calls for mention. The buildings include a
Council Chamber, a Town Hall, a meeting-room for the
Commissioners of Supply, a post office, and four or
five suites of offices for the burgh officials. The main
entrance has a fine semi-classic door-piece, surmounted
by two statues of the ancient halberdiers of the burgh
in full uniform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="" width="507" height="700" />
<p class="captioncenter">Town Hall, Kirkwall</p>
</div>

<p>Down to past the middle of the nineteenth century
many Orcadian landed proprietors possessed town houses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>at Kirkwall, in which they lived during the winter.
Several of these houses were buildings of some architectural
quality, and an interesting survival is Tankerness
House, in the Main Street, the property of Mr Alfred
Baikie of Tankerness. This building is, with some later
additions or conversions, a quaint conjunction of several
old residences which at one time constituted manses
of cathedral dignitaries. The house has, however, been
in the possession of the Baikie family since 1641.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_081.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="436" />
<p class="captioncenter">Balfour Castle, Shapinsay</p>
</div>

<p>Balfour Castle in Shapinsay, the residence of Colonel
W. E. L. Balfour of Balfour and Trenabie, is one of the
finest specimens of Scottish Baronial architecture in
the north of Scotland. Erected in 1847 from designs
of the late David Bryce, R.S.A., Balfour Castle is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>effective as a whole without being conspicuous in
detail. The house is surrounded by fine gardens and
plantations.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_082.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="536" />
<p class="captioncenter">Tankerness House, Kirkwall</p>
</div>

<p>Melsetter House in Walls, as it existed down to
1898, is an excellent example of the older Orcadian
country houses, few of which now survive. The older
part of the building, as it appears on page 32, dates from
the later seventeenth century. The house was originally
a country residence of the Bishops of Orkney, a fact
which may account for its roughly cruciform construction.
The place was twice sacked by Jacobites in 1746, during
the absence of the owner, Captain Benjamin Moodie,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>with the Royal army. The gardens and grounds are
exceptionally fine for those northern latitudes.</p>

<p>Two other interesting old Scoto-Orcadian mansions
are Skaill House in Sandwick, and Carrick House in
Eday, the latter erected in the seventeenth century by
John, brother of Earl Patrick Stewart, who was himself
created Earl of Carrick by King Charles <abbr title="1">I</abbr>. At a later
date the house was the property of James Fea of
Clestrain, who in 1725 captured in the neighbourhood
the celebrated pirate John Gow.</p>

<p>In the towns and villages of Orkney and Shetland,
where the main street usually runs parallel to the shore,
many of the houses stand with one gable towards the
street and the other closely overlooking the sea, a
feature which gives a distinctly foreign aspect to Lerwick
and Stromness in particular. It is sober fact that in
many houses in Stromness, granted a taste for fish, and
a high tide at the appropriate hour, one can catch one’s
breakfast from the gable windows before getting out
of bed.</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left"> <a name="Section_18" id="Section_18"></a> 18. Communications, Past and Present</h2>


<p>Before the days of steam communication there were
two ferries across the Pentland Firth to Huna in Caithness,
one from Walls and the other from South Ronaldshay.
Edinburgh was the usual objective of Orcadians
using this route, and Shanks’ nag the common means
of locomotion, save for persons of quality, who rode
horses. The only other means of reaching the Scottish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>capital, the sole place out of the Islands which old-world
Orcadians considered of much account, and a place
where all the well-to-do among them had relations,
cronies, and “gude-gangin’ pleas,” was by occasional
sailing packets from Kirkwall to Leith.</p>

<p>Steamboat communication between Kirkwall and
Leith and Aberdeen was established about 1832, and
nowadays there are two boats a week between these
ports and the Orcadian capital, besides two to Stromness,
and a fortnightly boat to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Margaret’s Hope. There
is also a daily mail-steamer from Stromness, touching
at Kirkwall (Scapa) and South Ronaldshay, to Scrabster
in Caithness, thus connecting the Islands with the
Highland Railway at Thurso. Stromness is farther
connected with Liverpool and Manchester by a weekly
steamer, and both Kirkwall and Stromness with Lerwick
and Scalloway in Shetland. Kirkwall has communication
with the more important of the North Isles,
and Stromness with the chief of the South Isles (except
South Ronaldshay and Burray) by local steamers
sailing several times a week. Motor or horse conveyances
run between Kirkwall and Stromness several
times a day. There are no railways in Orkney.</p>

<p>The first Orkney Road Act was passed in 1857,
and under that and subsequent local Acts, and finally
under the Roads and Bridges (Scotland) Act of 1874,
the greater part of the roads in the county were constructed.
The agricultural depression and land legislation
of the “eighties,” by attenuating the incomes
of proprietors, tended somewhat to check this develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>ment;
but a dozen years or so later the Congested
Districts Board came to the rescue with grants-in-aid,
largely by means of which many miles of new roads
were completed. With very few exceptions, all the
islands of any population are now amply provided with
good roads.</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left"> <a name="Section_19" id="Section_19"></a> 19. Administration and Divisions</h2>

<p>Orkney forms one Sheriffdom with Caithness and
Shetland, and has a resident Sheriff-Substitute at
Kirkwall. There is one Lord-Lieutenant for Orkney
and Shetland, but his deputies and the Commission of
the Peace are appointed separately for each group. In
all other matters of county administration Orkney
forms a separate unit, and for the purposes of the Local
Government (Scotland) Act of 1889 the county is
divided into four districts, one comprising the Mainland,
one the North Isles, one the civil parish of South Ronaldshay
and Burray, and the fourth the two parishes of
Walls and Flotta and Hoy and Graemsay. A feature
of county administration perhaps peculiar to Orkney
is that each island forms a unit of assessment for the
construction and maintenance of its own roads. The
control of piers and harbours in Orkney is of a somewhat
diversified order. The Orkney Piers and Harbours
Commissioners, a body acting under special statutes,
control the piers and harbours at Kirkwall, Scapa,
Holm in the Mainland, and at Stronsay, Sanday, and
Westray in the North Isles. Stromness and <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Margaret’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>Hope possess their own Harbour or Pier Commissioners,
and the piers at Longhope, Burray, Egilsay, and North
Ronaldshay are managed by the County Council.</p>

<p>Of 21 civil parishes in Orkney, Walls and Flotta,
Hoy and Graemsay, and South Ronaldshay and Burray
are in the South Isles; Stromness, Sandwick, Harray
and Birsay, Evie and Rendal, Firth, Stenness, Orphir,
Kirkwall and <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Ola, Holm, and <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Andrews and Deerness
are in the Mainland; and Shapinsay, Stronsay, Eday,
Rousay, Westray, Papa Westray, Lady, and Cross and
Burness are in the North Isles.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastically Orkney forms a Synod of the Church
of Scotland, comprising the three Presbyteries of Kirkwall,
Cairston (the old name of Stromness), and North
Isles. There are 27 ecclesiastical parishes. <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Magnus
Cathedral is a collegiate church, with ministers of first
and second charge.</p>

<p>The standard of education in the Islands is quite up
to the average of Scotland. There are higher grade
schools at Kirkwall and Stromness, and the ordinary
sources of educational revenue are supplemented in
various parts of the county by endowments of considerable
value.</p>

<p>Orkney joins with Shetland in returning a representative
to Parliament.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left"><a name="Section_20" id="Section_20"></a> 20. The Roll of Honour</h2>


<p>Of heroes of the sword and men of high ruling capacity
Scandinavian Orkney produced many, who on a wider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>field of action would assuredly have left to the world
at large names now chiefly known to the special student
of Orcadian history. Apart too from mere men of action,
personalities like <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Magnus, <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Rognvald, and William
the Old, first Bishop of Orkney, would grace the annals
even of a great people. Of distinguished men of the
soldier and statesman type modern Orkney has, however,
produced few, a circumstance no doubt in part
due to the distance of the Islands from the centre of
national activity. The Royalist general James King,
Lord Eythin (b. 1589), was a native of Hoy. Fighting
in the Thirty Years’ War, in the service of Gustavus
Adolphus, he attained the rank of major-general, but
was recalled to England in 1640. He received a command
in the Civil War under Lord Newcastle, and in
1643 was created a peer of Scotland. He died in
Sweden in 1652. Perhaps the two most distinguished
naval officers whom Orkney can lay claim to are Commodore
James Moodie of Melsetter, who performed
valuable services in the War of the Spanish Succession,
and Admiral Alexander Graeme of Graemeshall, a
veteran of the Great War.</p>

<p class="captioncenter">John Rae</p>
</div>

<p>Among explorers two Orcadians stand high, John
Rae and William Balfour Baikie, both explorers of the
highest scientific type, while Baikie was in addition a
good naturalist and a distinguished philologist. John
Rae the famous Arctic explorer, of the Hall of Clestrain,
near Stromness, entered the service of the Hudson
Bay Company, under whose auspices he in 1846 commanded
an expedition which linked up the coastline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>between the discoveries of Ross in Boothia and those
of Parry at Fury and Hecla Strait. In 1847 Rae joined
the first land expedition in search of Franklin, and
performed important exploration and scientific work.
In 1850 he himself commanded a fresh expedition,
which mapped a large part of the coast of Wollaston
Land, and examined to about 100° the south and east
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>coasts of Victoria Land. For the geographical results
of this expedition, and for his earlier survey work, he
in 1852 received the Founders’ gold medal of the Royal
Geographical Society. His final Arctic expedition,
organised by the Hudson’s Bay Company in 1853,
put the cope-stone to his fame, for on that expedition
he at last succeeded in obtaining definite information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>regarding the fate of Sir John Franklin, and in purchasing
relics of that hapless explorer and his party from
the Eskimos. He died in London in July 1893, at
the age of eighty, and was at his own request buried
in the churchyard of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Magnus Cathedral at Kirkwall.
John Rae was a man of splendid physique and persevering
will, and a consideration of his work as a whole places
him among the greatest of Polar explorers.</p>

<p>William Balfour Baikie, M.D., was born at Kirkwall
in 1825. After serving for some years as a surgeon in
the Navy and at Haslar Hospital, he obtained the
post of surgeon and naturalist to the Niger expedition
of 1854. On the death of the captain of the exploring
ship “Pleiad” at Fernando Po, Baikie succeeded to the
command, and this voyage, which penetrated 250
miles higher up the Niger than had yet been reached,
he described in his <cite>Narrative of an Exploring Voyage up
the Niger and Isadda</cite>. In 1857 Baikie left England on
a second expedition. In the course of five years he
opened up the navigation of the Niger, made roads,
established markets, collected vocabularies of various
African dialects, and translated parts of the Bible and
Book of Common Prayer into Hausa. Baikie died
at Sierra Leone, while on his way home on leave, on
17th December, 1864. The loving-care of his fellow-islanders
has erected a fitting and touching memorial
to him in that great fane of the Isles which holds,
or ought to hold, the memorials of all distinguished
Orcadians.</p>

<p>Orkney has been the birthplace of many men of high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>scientific attainments. Murdoch MacKenzie (d. 1797)
was a distinguished hydrographer, who from 1752 to
1771 performed an enormous amount of professional
work as surveyor to the Admiralty. His <cite>Treatise on
Marine Surveying</cite> is still esteemed. James Copland,
M.D., a native of Deerness, was one of the leading
medical men of his day (1791-1870). After picking up
a knowledge of tropical diseases in West Africa, and
travelling in France and Germany, he settled in London.
His once famous <cite>Dictionary of Practical Medicine</cite>, however,
with its 3509 double-column, small-type pages, a
book by one man on every branch of medical science,
soon degenerated into one of the curiosities of literature.
Thomas Stewart Traill (1781-1862), son of a parish
minister of Kirkwall, was professor of medical jurisprudence
at Edinburgh University. Himself a man of
almost universal learning, he fitly edited the eighth
edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. Matthew
Forster Heddle, a son of Robert Heddle of Melsetter,
was professor of chemistry at the University of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr>
Andrews, and a mineralogist of great distinction. His
great collection of Scottish minerals, now in the Royal
Scottish Museum at Edinburgh, is one of the finest
things of the kind that any country possesses. To
these names we would add those of the Rev. Charles
Clouston, minister of the parish of Sandwick, a distinguished
meteorologist and naturalist, and of Sir
Thomas Smith Clouston, the late distinguished specialist
in mental pathology.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Strange, highly renowned as an engraver,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>was a son of David Strang, Burgh Treasurer of Kirkwall.
Strange joined the Jacobites in 1745, engraved the
Prince’s portrait and the plate for his bank-notes. He
escaped alive from Culloden and evaded the search
for him. Settling in London, he became the foremost
in his art. One of his works is the engraving of West’s
Apotheosis of George <abbr title="3">III</abbr>’s children, Octavius and
Alfred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<p>The most celebrated literary man whom the Islands
can lay claim to is Malcolm Laing (1762-1818), the
Scottish constitutional historian and protagonist in
the Ossianic controversy. A friend of Charles James
Fox, and a class-fellow of Lord Brougham, Laing sat
in Parliament for the county in the Whig interest from
1807 to 1812. In 1808 he withdrew from the literary
circles of Edinburgh to his home in the Islands, and
here in 1814 he was visited by Sir Walter Scott. Malcolm
Laing’s younger brother, Samuel, was the author of
<cite>Travels in Norway</cite>, <cite>A Tour in Sweden</cite>, and <cite>Notes of a Traveller</cite>. A greater work, however, was his translation
of the <cite>Heimskringla</cite>, the old Icelandic history of the
early Kings of Norway, by Snorri Sturlason, a performance
which had an important bearing on the hero-worship
gospel of Carlyle. High literary ability appears
to run in the blood of the Laings. Samuel Laing’s son,
of the same name, was the author of those popular
compendiums of nineteenth century science and
thought, <cite>Human Origins</cite>, and <cite>Modern Science and
Modern Thought</cite>, which are still in wide circulation.</p>

<p>David Vedder (1790-1854), an almost self-taught
miscellaneous writer, of large output and considerable
excellence, was born in the parish of Deerness. In
1830 he conducted the <cite>Edinburgh Literary Gazette</cite>,
supported by De Quincey and others. The various
works of Vedder, which include <cite>Orcadian Sketches</cite>, and
<cite>Poems, Legendary, Lyrical, and Descriptive</cite>, have fallen
on an undeserved oblivion. Vedder is the Orcadian
poet <em>par excellence</em>. Perhaps the once highly popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>novels of the amiable Mary Balfour, or Brunton, <cite>Self-Control</cite>,
1811, and <cite>Discipline</cite>, 1815, would not now
be considered a passport to fame; but a later member
of the family to which she belonged, David Balfour
of Trenabie, has in his <cite>Odal Rights and Feudal Wrongs</cite>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>written of the Scottish oppressions of Orkney in the
sixteenth century in such fine limpid English as makes
one regret the purely local interest of his subject. Walter
Traill Dennison, who in his <cite>Orcadian Sketch Book</cite> has
given his fellow-islanders some light fiction of a high
quality, unfortunately elected to write in the strictly
local dialect of the North Isles of Orkney, using a
phonetic spelling which is a stumbling-block to many
readers who are quite at home in ordinary Scots literature.
Traill Dennison, like Vedder, is a humourist, and
Orkney gifted to the outside world a greater humourist
than either when she sent the father of Washington
Irving across the sea.</p>

<p>Orkney has produced scarce a churchman or a lawyer
who has distinguished himself <em>as such</em>. The great
Robert Reid, founder of Edinburgh University, was
perhaps the most celebrated of her pre-reformation
bishops, while James Atkine, a native of Kirkwall, was
bishop of Moray in the seventeenth century. William
Honyman, of the Honymans of Graemsay, sat on the
Scottish bench as Lord Armidale in the early part of the
nineteenth century, but his marrying Lord Braxfield’s
daughter was perhaps his doughtiest feat. The list of
Orkney Sheriffs, however, includes the famous names of
Charles Neaves, Adam Gifford, and William Edmonstone
Aytoun. Aytoun kept house at Berstane, near Kirkwall,
and his humourous sketch <cite>The Dreep-daily Burghs</cite>, is
supposed to make covert allusion to the climatic and
other amenities of the group of parliamentary burghs
of which the Orcadian capital at that time formed one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>His connection with the Islands also inspired his poem
of <cite>Bothwell</cite>; and contact with the surrounding seas
moved the lively Neaves to verse of nigh as dolorous
strain.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Kirkwall</b> (3810), is situated at the northern end of a low
isthmus dividing the Mainland into two, and has a harbour
on two sides, that at Scapa Bay to the south being the
port of call for the daily mail-steamer to Caithness. The
harbour of Kirkwall proper, facing to the north, was
designed by Telford, and is the place of general traffic.
The town takes its name, in Norse <em>Kirkjuvágr</em>,<a name="fnanchor_1_1" id="fnanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> churchbay,
from the old parish church of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Olaf, supposed to have
been erected by Jarl Rognvald <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, <i>c.</i> 1040, but it only
became the capital of the Islands after the foundation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>the cathedral in 1137, and the consequent transfer of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
seat of the Bishopric from Birsay. Kirkwall received its
earliest charter as royal burgh from James <abbr title="3">III</abbr>, in 1486,
and was visited by James <abbr title="5">V</abbr>, in 1540. Of several later
charters the governing one is that granted by Charles <abbr title="2">II</abbr>,
in 1661. The population consists mainly of professional
men, tradesmen, artisans, and labourers, there being no
manufactures of consequence, although fish-curing is
prosecuted to some extent, and there are two distilleries
adjacent to the town. The volume of trade is very considerable,
however, as the town shares with Stromness the
position of shopping and shipping centre for a large and
comparatively well-to-do agricultural community. The
ancient Grammar School of Kirkwall, now housed in a
spacious modern building and styled the Burgh School,
has given the rudiments of education to many distinguished
sons of town and county. The institution dates at least
from Danish times (1397-1468). Owing to the narrowness
of the streets, and the many old buildings both public
and private, the general impression created by the town
is one of quaint antiqueness; while the Oyce, a miniature
inland sea on its north-western outskirts, imparts an
additional touch of picturesque individuality to the place.
Two weekly newspapers, <cite>The Orcadian</cite> and <cite>The Orkney
Herald</cite>, are published at Kirkwall.

scattered along the lower coasts of its splendid bay a
Customs House, a good hotel, two post offices, and a few
shops. Two martello towers, one on each side of the
entrance to the bay, attest the importance of the anchorage
at the period of the Great War, when as many as 200 sail
of merchantmen at times lay there awaiting convoy. The
bay is now a coaling station and much appreciated harbour
of refuge for steamers, especially trawlers on their way
to and from the northern fishing grounds. It also constitutes
a sort of headquarters for the naval vessels

Norse as Ronaldsvaag, and was the rendezvous of King
Hakon’s fleet in the expedition of Largs. The village

in Orkney. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_27" title="Go to page 27">27</a>, <a href="#Page_84" title="Go to page 84">84</a>, <a href="#Page_85" title="Go to page 85">85</a>.)</p>

6 miles S.S.E. of Kirkwall. From here Montrose sailed

<p><b>Stromness</b> (1653), one of the most picturesquely situated
towns in Scotland, skirts the W. and N.W. sides of a
beautiful bay in the S.W. of the Mainland, which for years
was the last port of call for outward bound Greenland
whalers and the vessels of the Hudson’s Bay Company,
and also a touching point both outwards and homewards
for the ships of many Arctic expeditions. As a burgh of
barony Stromness dates from 1817, but as a village it had
already made history. In the early part of the eighteenth
century the vessels engaged in the American rice trade
having made the safe little bay the depôt for unloading
their cargoes for the various ports of Britain, the growing
commerce of the place attracted the jealousy of Kirkwall.
The magistrates of the Orcadian capital, founding on two
obscure Acts of 1690 and 1693, which appeared to confine
the right to such trading to freemen inhabiting royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>burghs, and to such other communities as agreed to pay
cess to a royal burgh, tried to tax the trade of Stromness
out of existence. The people of Stromness, after submitting
to these imposts for many years, between 1743
and 1758 fought their oppressors in the Court of Session
and the House of Lords, both of which tribunals decided
that “there was no sufficient right in the burgh of Kirkwall
to assess the village of Stromness, but that the said village
should be quit therefrom, and free therefrom in all time
coming.” As the case was a test one, the courage shown
by this little Orcadian community freed all the villages
of Scotland from the exactions of the royal burghs. Stromness
was visited by Sir Walter Scott in 1814, and by Hugh
Miller in 1847, the latter of whom exhumed from the
neighbouring flagstones the specimen of asterolepis which
he deals with in his <cite>Footprints of the Creator</cite>. Interesting
natives or inhabitants of Stromness were John Gow, or
Smith, the original of Scott’s Cleveland in <cite>The Pirate</cite>, a
man whose true history has been told by Defoe; and
George Stewart, the “Bounty” mutineer, of whom Byron
writes in his poem <cite>The Island</cite>:</p>

<p><em>Shetland</em> or <em>Zetland</em> is derived from the Norse <em>Hjaltland</em>,
variant spellings being <em>Hieltland</em>, <em>Hietland</em>, <em>Hetland</em>.
The Norse word is of doubtful origin.</p>

<p>Like Orkney, Shetland cannot be regarded as strictly
a Scottish county till the seventeenth century. During
that century various County Acts were framed for
the better government of the islands. These lasted
till 1747, when heritable jurisdiction was abolished and
the judicial administration of Shetland was assimilated
to the general Scottish system.</p>

<p>Shetland has the same Lord-Lieutenant as Orkney,
but separate Deputy Lieutenants and Justices of the
Peace. It shares a Sheriff-Principal with Orkney and
Caithness, but has a Sheriff-Substitute of its own. The
County Council, the Education Authority, Parish
Councils, and Town Council of Lerwick are the administrative
bodies. The civil parishes are: Unst,
Fetlar, Yell, Northmavine, Delting, Walls, Sandsting,
Nesting, Tingwall, Lerwick, Bressay, Dunrossness.</p>

<p>In Parliament one member represents both Orkney
and Shetland.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastically the parishes are divided into three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
presbyteries, Lerwick, Burravoe and Olnafirth, which
make up the Synod of Shetland.</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left">2. General Characteristics</h2>

<p>The county of Shetland is entirely insular, and its
characteristics are varied. The coastline is generally
broken and rugged, and in many places precipitous;
while the larger islands are intersected by numerous
bays and voes stretching far inland, which form safe
and commodious places of anchorage and easy means
of communication. No point in Shetland is more than
three miles from the sea. Detached rocks and stacks,
some high above the water and others below the surface,
present a forbidding aspect to the spectator, and increase
the dangers of navigation round the coast.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_104.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="456" />
<p class="captioncenter">Crofter’s Cottage</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>
<p>To be near the sea&mdash;their chief source of food&mdash;the
early settlers made their homes close to the shore, where
also they generally found the soil better than further
inland. Accordingly most of the houses and crofts
are situated along the coast, and in particular at the
heads of voes, where often townships and villages have
been formed. One striking feature is the bold contrast
between the green cultivated township and the dark
background of moor or hill, sharply marked off from
each other by the ancient “toon” dykes. Still more
noticeable are the large tracts of permanent pasture,
where one may still see the ruins of cottages, once the
homes of crofters who were evicted to make room for
sheep.</p>

<p>The principal fuel in the islands is peat, the cutting
of which, carried on for centuries, ever since the time
of Torf Einar, who is said to have taught the natives
the use of “turf” for burning, has denuded the surface,
and left it blacker than it otherwise would be. That,
and the practice of “scalping” turf for roofing purposes,
have laid bare great stretches of what might have been
fairly good pasture ground.</p>

<p>The proportion of arable land is very small compared
with the whole land surface of the islands. For
this reason Shetland has never figured as an agricultural
county; and other causes may be mentioned, such as
divided attention between the two branches of industry&mdash;fishing
and crofting; indifferent soil; variable climate;
antiquated methods of cultivation; and want of
markets for agricultural produce.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>Being far removed from the centres of commerce,
and having few natural resources in themselves, the
islands are almost entirely lacking in manufactures.
Fishing and farming are the chief industrial pursuits,
while the rearing of native sheep, ponies and cattle form
a considerable part of the rural economy. Along with
every croft or holding goes the right of common pasturage
in the hills and moors, called “scattald.” Crofts would
be of little value without this common grazing, which
is a remnant of the old Norse odal system of land tenure,
and is peculiar to the islands of Shetland and Orkney.
The word <i lang="nn" xml:lang="nn">scattald</i> is from <em>scat</em>, a payment, akin to <em>scot</em>
in “scot and lot.”</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left">3. Size. Position. Boundaries</h2>


<p>In size, Shetland ranks fifteenth among the Scottish
counties; but in population only twenty-seventh.
The total area (excluding water) is 352,319 acres or 550½
square miles. The group consists of about one hundred
islands, of which twenty-nine are inhabited. The
largest is Mainland, which embraces about three-fourths
of the whole land-surface; and the others, in point
of size, are Yell, Unst, Fetlar, Bressay and Whalsay.
Yell measures 17½ miles by 6½, Unst 12 by nearly 6.
The smaller islands include East and West Burra, Muckle
Roe, Papa Stour, Skerries, Fair Isle and Foula; the
remainder consisting of islets, holms, stacks and skerries.
From Fair Isle, which lies about mid-way between
Orkney and Shetland, to Sumburgh Head, is 20¼ miles;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>and from that point to Flugga in Unst, in a straight
line, is 71 miles. From Sumburgh Head to Fethaland,
the most northerly part of the Mainland, is 54 miles;
and the greatest breadth, from the Mull of Eswick to
Muness, is about 21 miles.</p>

<p>Including Fair Isle and Foula, the group lies between
the parallels of 59° 30´ and 60° 52´ north latitude; and
between 0° 43´ and 2° 7´ west longitude. The general
trend of the islands is north-easterly, and their position
in relation to the mainland of Scotland is also in that
direction; Sumburgh Head being 95 miles north-east
of Caithness and 164 miles north of Aberdeen.</p>

<p>The North Sea washes the eastern sea-board, and
the Atlantic Ocean the western; sea and ocean join
forces between Sumburgh Head and Fair Isle to form
that turbulent tideway called the “Roost.” They
also meet north of Yell and Unst, where the Atlantic
sets strongly through Yell Sound and Blue Mull Sound
for six hours during flood tide, and the North Sea, in
its turn, in the opposite direction for the other six hours.</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left">4. Surface and General Features</h2>


<p>The surface of the larger islands is hilly, and the
general direction of the ridges is north and south,
corresponding to the length of the islands. The inland
parts present an undulating surface of peat bogs and
moorland, dotted here and there with fresh-water lochs,
which accentuate, rather than relieve, the monotony
of the landscape. The hills are round or conical in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>shape and of moderate height, ranging from 500 to 900
feet. Unlike the rounded hills of the Lowlands of
Scotland, which are often grassy to the top, most of the
Shetland hills are brown and barren, being covered
with heather and moss or short coarse grass. Neither
have they the rugged grandeur of the Highlands, for
the sides are generally smooth and rounded, the result
of intense glaciation.</p>

<p>The highest in the Mainland is Ronas Hill, Northmavine,
a great mass of red granite, rising to a height
of 1475 feet, forming the culminating point of the North
Roe tableland, and having the hilly ridge of the Björgs
on its eastern side. A long range of hills extends through
the parish of Delting, from Firth Ness to Olnafirth;
and from the south side of that inlet it extends southward
to Russa Ness on the west side of Weisdale Voe.
This is the loftiest range, and the southern ridge forms
a complete barrier between the east and west side of
that part of the Mainland. The highest hill in this
chain is Scallafield, 921 feet. Other two parallel ridges
lie east of this, the one from the east side of Weisdale
Voe to Dales Voe in Delting; and the other from near
Scalloway in a north-east direction to Collafirth. There
are breaks in these hilly ridges, notably where the
county road crosses over near Sandwater, and again
between Olnafirth on the west and Dury Voe on the
east. The other range worthy of note extends from
the Wart of Scousburgh in Dunrossness, with intervening
breaks, to the east of Scalloway, where it divides into
two ridges, and stretches onward to the east and west
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>sides of Dales Voe. Fitful Head in the south, 928 feet;
Sandness Hill in the west, 817 feet; the Sneug in Foula,
1372 feet; the Wart of Bressay, 742 feet; and the Noup
of Noss, 592 feet, are conspicuous land-marks round
the coast. The island of Yell is hilly, with parallel
ridges running north-east and south-west&mdash;highest point,
the Ward of Otterswick. A range of hills extends along
the west side of Unst&mdash;highest point, Vallafield, 708 feet.
In the extreme north is Hermaness, 657 feet; while on
the opposite side of Burrafirth is the still higher hill
of Saxa Vord, 934 feet.</p>

<p>In the larger islands the land is generally lower on
the east side than on the west; and in many cases the
hills are steeper on the west than on the east. Most
of the smaller islands are low-lying and grassy, forming
excellent pasture ground for sheep.</p>

<p>There are many fresh-water lochs in the islands, the
largest being Girlsta Loch in Tingwall, Loch of Cliff in
Unst, and Spiggie in Dunrossness. They are nearly
all well stocked with trout, which makes Shetland
attractive to anglers. Shetland has no streams large
enough to be called rivers; but it has burns in plenty,
rippling brooks in summer and brawling torrents of
brown peaty water in winter, when the soil is sodden
with rain or snow.</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left">5. Geology and Soil</h2>


<p>The geological map shows that metamorphic rocks
cover the greater part of Shetland. These rocks are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>represented by the clayslates and schists that extend
from Fitful Head to the Mull of Eswick; and by the
gneiss found from Scalloway to Delting, and also on
Burra Isle and Trondra, Whalsay and Skerries, Yell, the
west side of Unst and of Fetlar, the east side of Northmavine,
and the north sea-board of the Sandness-Aithsting
peninsula. Associated with the two series
of metamorphic rock are bands of quartzite; while at
Fladdabister, Tingwall, Whiteness, Weisdale, Northmavine
and Unst are beds of limestone.</p>

<p>The geological formation of Unst is interesting. The
gneiss on the west is succeeded by a band of mica,
chlorite and graphite schists. Next come zones of
serpentine and gabbro, to be followed by schistose rocks
at Muness. Fetlar shows a similar formation.</p>

<p>Of the igneous rocks we may mention first the intrusive
granites of Northmavine, Muckle Roe, Vementry, Papa
Stour, Melby and South Sandsting. A bed of diorite
extends from Ronas Voe to Olnafirth. Part of Muckle
Roe also shows diorite. Syenite occurs round Loch
Spiggie and is traced northward through Oxna and
Hildasay to Bixter and Aith. Lava, tuff, and other
volcanic materials appear in various parts of the islands,
as between Stennis and Ockran Head, in Northmavine,
Papa Stour, the Holm of Melby, Vementry and Bressay.</p>

<p>The predominating sedimentary rocks in Shetland
belong to the Old Red Sandstone formation. These
are found from Sumburgh Head to Rova Head, and
in Fair Isle, Mousa and Bressay. The fault or boundary
line between them and the metamorphic rocks is clearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>traceable at various points along the east of the Mainland.
Foula, Sandness and Papa Stour, on the west, show
remnants of Old Red Sandstone. This formation is
believed to have once covered the whole area now
represented by the Shetlands. To the same geological
period the hardened sandstone is considered to belong,
which occurs in the western peninsula, covering most
of the district of Sandness, Walls, Sandsting and
Aithsting.</p>

<p>Glacial phenomena&mdash;striae, moraines, boulders&mdash;are
interesting features in the geology of Shetland. Over
Unst, Fetlar, Yell and the north of Mainland the movement
of the ice had been uniformly from east to west.
Over the middle and southern districts, the glaciers
had curved in a north-westerly direction.</p>

<p>The variety of rocks accounts for the variety of soils
in the islands. There are many fertile regions of sandy
and loamy soil. Perhaps the best is the limestone
district of Tingwall. Most of the county, however, is
covered with peat moss and peaty soil.</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left">6. Natural History</h2>


<p>The mammals of Shetland are comparatively few.
There are no deer, foxes or badgers. Rats and mice are
numerous, hedgehogs are fairly common. Moles and
bats are unknown. So, too, are snakes, lizards, frogs
and toads. The weasel is found in many districts,
and its near relative, the ferret, is used for hunting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>rabbits, which are plentiful everywhere. Hares were
imported some time ago, but have a hard struggle for
existence with so many enemies around. Along the
shore may occasionally be seen the sea-otter, when he
comes up on a rock to enjoy a feast of sea-trout, or to
venture inland in search of fresh water. He must needs
be wary, as he is greatly sought after for the sake of his
valuable skin. Another amphibian is the seal, whose
habitat is the base of inaccessible cliffs and out-lying
rocks and isles.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_112.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="461" />
<p class="captioncenter">Kittiwakes. Noss Isle</p>
</div>

<p>The birds of Shetland may be divided into residents,
summer visitors, and winter visitors. In the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>annual migrations which take place in spring and again
in autumn, the islands form a resting-place for the
feathered voyagers, some of whom stay to nest. Sea
fowl naturally predominate. The gull family is the
most numerous and includes the great black-backed
gull, the lesser black-back, the herring gull, the common
gull, the black-headed gull and the pretty kittiwake.
Shags (scarfs) and cormorants are abundant all the
year round; and in their season come the guillemots,
razorbills, puffins, manx shearwaters and little auks.
The guillemots congregate in thousands on the rocky
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>ledges of cliffs, where each female lays a solitary egg
on the bare rock. The egg is so formed that, even if
disturbed, it will not roll off the shelf on which it lies.
The plumage of the black guillemot or “tystie” during
the winter season is of a mottled-grey colour, and the
bird is difficult to recognise in its changed appearance.
Eider ducks are abundant, and the great northern diver
(emmer goose) may often be seen.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_113.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="509" />
<p class="captioncenter">Shag on Nest. Noss Isle</p>
</div>

<p>Colonies of fulmar petrels are spreading all round
the coast, while the stormy petrel comes to nest in the
outer islands. The piratical skua is common; and the
great skua, which is strictly protected, is on the increase
in certain localities. Among the shore birds may be
mentioned the noisy terns and oyster-catchers. In the
winter come the turnstones, sandpipers, dunlins and
redshanks. Among the divers may be noted the
golden-eye, merganser, and long-tailed duck, while the
stock-duck, teal and widgeon are fairly plentiful.</p>

<p>Wild geese and swans, and flocks of rooks occasionally
rest on their journey, but the rooks, though numerous
elsewhere in Britain, do not take up residence in Shetland
longer than they can help. Ravens and hooded-crows
are plentiful. The peregrine falcon, the merlin, the
kestrel and the lordly sea-eagle are among the birds
of prey. Of game birds, the ringed plover, curlew,
snipe, golden plover and rock pigeons are common,
while woodcock make their appearance during the
migratory flight in autumn.</p>

<p>Starlings, sparrows and linnets are plentiful; and
owing to the almost entire absence of other songsters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>the song of the skylark is more noticeable. Among
summer visitors may be mentioned the wheat-ear, landrail
and peewit, while swallows and martins may be
seen occasionally. Winter visitors include fieldfares,
buntings, redwings, robin redbreasts, blackbirds,
thrushes and the smallest of all British birds, the
golden-crested wren. The tiny wren, misnamed the
“robin,” with its cheery song and hide-and-seek ways
among the rocks, stays all the year round, as do also the
rock and meadow pipits.</p>

<p>Absence of trees and hedgerows, and the general
bareness of the ground, bring into prominence the
different varieties of wild flowers. On the moors and
hillsides grow the crisp heather and heath, with
occasional patches of crowberry, while peeping out
among these are the milk-wort, the butter-wort and
bog asphodel, with the downy cotton-grass in damp
places. The pretty yellow tormentil is everywhere
among the stunted grass. The spotted orchis, the
yellow buttercup and the lovely grass of Parnassus
are also conspicuous on the grassy uplands. In meadow
lands and marshy places are found the purple orchis,
marsh-marigold, marsh cinquefoil, lady’s smock, ragged
robin, and red and yellow rattle, while in ditches may
be seen different varieties of the crow-foot tribe and
scorpion grass (forget-me-nots). On dry banks may be
found the scented thyme, white and yellow bed-straws,
and near by, the bird’s foot trefoil. Daisies, scentless
Mayweed and eyebrights are everywhere. In some
corn-lands the red poppy shines forth; while the wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>mustard and radish (runchie) are only too common.
Growing in the cliffs are rose-root, scurvy grass and
sea-campions (misnamed sweet-william). The vernal
squill, hawk-weed and sheep’s scabious spangle the
green pasture, and sea-pinks are all round the shore,
extending in some places to the water’s edge. The
mountain-ash, the wild rose and the honeysuckle grow
in sheltered nooks.</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left">7. Round the Coast&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Along the
East from Fair Isle to Unst</h2>


<p>The extent of coastline is enormous, and only the
outstanding features can be noted here.</p>

<p>Fair Isle, rock-bound, precipitous and lonely, with
but one or two small creeks where vessels may shelter,
has two lighthouses, each with a fog-siren and a
group-flashing white light&mdash;the Scaddon, visible 16
miles, and the Scroo, visible 23 miles. It was on Fair
Isle that <em>El Gran Grifon</em>, one of the Armada ships,
was wrecked in 1588.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_117.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="480" />
<p class="captioncenter">Sumburgh Head and Lighthouse</p>
</div>

<p>Sumburgh Head, the most southerly point of the
Mainland, is also capped with a lighthouse, perched 300
feet above the swirling eddies of the Roost. Erected
in 1820, it was the first lighthouse on the Shetland coast.
Its group-flashing white light is visible 24 miles in clear
weather. North of Sumburgh Head are Grutness Voe
and the Pool of Virkie, with their low-lying sandy shores;
while near by are Sumburgh House and the ruins of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>Jarlshoff. From this point northward the coast is
rocky, with moderately low cliffs, which are broken up
by the inlets of Voe and Troswick. The next conspicuous
point is the headland of Noness, crowned by a
small, quick-flashing white light, a guide to the busy
fishing centre of Sandwick, and the fine sandy bay of
Levenwick, which lies directly opposite. Passing
through Mousa Sound, we have on the right the low-lying
grazing island of Mousa with its famous Pictish
castle, and on the left Sandlodge, near which are disused
copper-mines. Two miles north of Mousa is the
low-lying point of Helliness, having at its base the small
harbour of Aithsvoe. From here onwards the coast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>is of varying heights, and broken by the exposed creeks
of Fladdabister, Quarff, Gulberwick, Sound and Brei
Wick. Bressay lighthouse, which has a revolving red
and white light, visible 16 miles, shows the way to
Bressay Sound and the harbour of Lerwick.</p>

<img src="images/i_119.jpg" alt="" width="305" height="500" />
<p class="captioncenter">Cliff Scenery, Noss. Bressay</p>
</div>

<p>The shores of Bressay are low-lying on the west and
north; but on the south are the high cliffs of the Ord
and Bard, the latter having the Orkneyman’s Cave
and the mural arch of the Giant’s Leg at its base. On
the east side of Noss Isle the cliffs are also high, forming
the favourite breeding-ground of myriads of sea-birds.
The diversity of the coastline, with the sudden transition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>from an uninteresting shore to bold, precipitous cliffs,
is owing to the dip of the rock-strata. If the dip is
to the sea, there is a more or less gradual slope <i>to</i> the
shore; but if the dip is <i>from</i> the sea, then there is the
towering cliff, facing the waves like a giant wall. A
good example of this is in the island of Noss, which
is 592 feet high at the Noup, and gradually slopes down
to near sea-level at the western side. The general
outline of the cliffs, too, depends on the texture of the
rocks. With sandstone, they tower up in regular layers
like a wall, bold and massive, with clear-cut caves and
tall stacks. With schistose and granite rocks, however,
the cliffs are more broken and rugged.</p>

<p>Proceeding from the north entrance of Lerwick
harbour, we find a light on Rova Head, with red, white
and green sectors, guiding the mariner to and from this
narrow channel. The sea is dotted with a number of
rocks and holms, requiring a skilled pilot to negotiate.
Towards the west open up the fine bays of Dales Voe,
Laxfirth, Wadbister Voe and Catfirth; and off the
point of Hawksness is the Unicorn rock, on which the
ship that was chasing the Earl of Bothwell was wrecked
(1567).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_121.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="502" />
<p class="captioncenter">Mavis Grind, looking south</p>
</div>

<p>Facing the bold promontory of the Mull of Eswick
stands the Maiden Stack; to seaward the Hoo Stack
and Sneckan; and extending eastward a succession of
rocks and skerries, which go by the name of the “stepping
stones.” Passing the bay of South Nesting, we
approach the “bonnie isle” of Whalsay, with the fine
bay of Dury Voe opposite. Between Whalsay and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>land lie a number of isles, the largest being West Linga,
while from the outer side, islands and rocks stretch in
an easterly direction, the farthest group being called
Out Skerries. The largest of these, Housay, Bruray
and Grunay, are inhabited; while on a small isle,
called Bound Skerry, is erected a fine lighthouse, which
shows a bright revolving white light, visible a distance
of 18 miles round. Passing Vidlin Voe and doubling
the long promontory of Lunna Ness, we reach Yell Sound.
On the right lies the island of Yell; on the left the triple
openings of Swining Voe, Collafirth and Dales Voe;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>and further on Firths Voe and Tofts Voe, with the ferry
of Mossbank between. After Orka Voe, we round Calback
Ness and enter the fine bay of Sullom Voe, extending
about eight miles inland. Only a narrow neck of land
separates it from Busta Voe on the west, while a little
to the northwards, at Mavis Grind, the distance between
Sullom Voe and the Atlantic is only a stone’s throw.
After Gluss Voe and the pretty bay of Ollaberry, Collafirth
is reached, and then Burravoe, the farthest roadstead
in Yell Sound. Looking back from this point,
we view the whole Sound with its many isles and holms,
low-lying, and affording good pasture for sheep. The
largest are Lamba, Brother Isle, Bigga, and Samphrey.
Near Samphrey are the Rumble Rocks, with a beacon
to aid navigation.</p>

<p>Returning to Yell Sound, we find on its north side
the two harbours of Hamnavoe and Burravoe, in
Yell. Proceeding north through the Sound, we pass
the bay of Ulsta and the Ness of Sound. From Ladie Voe
to Gloup Holm the coast is bold and rocky, with only
one inlet, Whale Firth, which runs inland till it almost
meets Mid Yell Voe. In the extreme north is Gloup
Voe. Blue Mull Sound, which separates Yell from Unst,
has the harbour of Cullivoe near the middle and Linga
Island at the south entrance. On the east coast of
Yell are the fine bays of Basta Voe and Mid Yell Voe,
with the island of Hascosay between.</p>

<p>Across Colgrave Sound lies Fetlar, one of the most
fertile of the islands. It is elevated towards the north-east,
where Vord Hill rises 521 feet. Hereabout the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>coast is precipitous and very imposing. The principal
openings are Tresta Wick in the South and Gruting
Wick in the east. Brough Lodge is a calling-place for
steamers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="captioncenter">Muckle Flugga Lighthouse</p>
  <p class="captioncenter">(Most northerly part of the British Isles)</p>
</div>

<p>Unst is the most northerly part of the British Isles.
In the south is the harbour of Uyea, east of which is
Muness with Muness Castle. The principal harbour
in Unst is Balta Sound, completely protected by the
islands of Balta and Huney. Further north is Haroldswick,
named after Harold Fairhair of Norway, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>landed here on his expedition against his rebellious
subjects. After passing the sandy bay of Norwick and
rounding Holm of Skaw, we reach the northern extremity
of Unst. The heights of Saxa Vord and Hermaness
hem in the entrance to Burrafirth. Rising from a
group of rocks, about a mile to seaward, is the Flugga,
with a fine lighthouse, which shows a fixed light, with
white and red sectors. From Hermaness to Blue Mull
Sound, the west of Unst is bold and rocky, with only
one inlet of importance, Lunda Wick.</p>
</div>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left">8. Round the Coast&mdash;(<i>b</i>) Along the
  West from Fethaland to Fitful Head</h2>


<p>A mile or two off the point of Fethaland are the
Ramna Stacks, huge rocks like giant sentinels guarding
the northern extremity of the Mainland. From this
point to the isle of Uyea, and onwards to Ronas Voe,
the chief feature of the coast is the high and rugged
granite cliffs, which gradually increase in height till
the voe is reached. This fine natural harbour, lying
round the base of Ronas Hill, forms, with Urafirth
on the opposite side, an extensive peninsula to the
westward. The coast line of the peninsula is rugged
and much indented, with wonderful caves and subterranean
passages, wrought out by the action of the
sea, the Grind of the Navir and the Holes of Scradda
being the most remarkable. Off the south coast lie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>the famous Dore Holm with its natural arch, and the
Drongs, resembling a ship under sail. Hillswick, in
Urafirth, is the terminal port of call for steamers on
the west side, and forms a convenient centre for the
many fine trout-fishing lochs in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>On the east of the extensive bay of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Magnus lies
Muckle Roe, with its sea-face of red granite cliffs. To
the south are the smaller grazing islands of Vementry
and Papa Little, with the channel of Swarbacks Minn
between, forming the common entrance to Busta Voe,
Olnafirth, Gonfirth and Aith Voe. Between the last
opening and Bixter Voe, on the opposite side, runs an
isthmus which connects Aithsting, Sandness, Walls
and Sandsting with the other part of the Mainland.
The northern side of the peninsula thus formed is
pierced by the openings of Clousta Voe, Unifirth and
West Burrafirth, while lying off the north-west extremity
is the fertile island of Papa Stour, with its
high cliffs and beautiful caves, Christie’s Hole being the
finest. About three miles to seaward are the dangerous
rocks of Ve Skerries. The coast from Sandness to
Vaila is bold and rocky, the headland of Watsness being
the turning-point on this rugged coast. About eighteen
miles to the south-west lies the lofty island of Foula.
The east side of the island is comparatively low-lying,
but the land rises towards the west, where the cliffs tower
1220 feet above the sea. A dangerous shoal, the Haevdi
Grund, lies to the east of the island, and it was here
that the liner <em>Oceanic</em> was wrecked (1914).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_126.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="416" />
<p class="captioncenter">The Kame, Foula</p>
</div>

<p>The island of Vaila lies across the mouth of Vaila
Sound, and bounds the entrance to the extensive bay of
Gruting Voe. From Skelda Ness to Scalloway the distance
is about seven miles across an arm of the sea, which
runs north and is broken up into many openings. Taken
in order, these are Skelda Voe, Seli Voe and Sand Voe;
Sand Sound, the common entrance to the voes of Bixter
and Tresta; Weisdale Voe; Stromness Voe with the
tidal loch of Strom; and Whiteness Voe. Lying off
the entrance of these two are the islands of Hildasay,
Oxna and Papa. Opposite Scalloway, and forming a
shelter to its harbour, is the island of Trondra. Further
south are East and West Burra and Havra, with the
long channel of Cliff Sound on their eastern side. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>fertile island of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Ninian, locally known as <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Ringans,
is joined to the land by a narrow isthmus of sand. To
the south lies the isle of Colsay opposite the inlet of
Spiggie. The high cliffs of Fitful Head form the termination
of the west, as Sumburgh Head of the east.
Between lies the fine sandy bay of Quendale, with its
background of sand dunes and rabbit warrens, while
to the south are the islands of Lady’s Holm, Little
Holm and Horse Island.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left">9. Climate</h2>


<p>As Shetland is entirely insular, and surrounded by
ocean currents considerably warmer than those of other
places in the same northern latitude, the climate is
wonderfully equable, extremes of heat and cold being
rare. The prevailing winds come from the south and
west, laden with warm moisture from the Atlantic to
temper the atmosphere. Added to that is the general
“drift” of the Atlantic towards the British Isles.
Of this warm current, Shetland gets its share.</p>

<p>When the air becomes laden with moisture, it is
lighter than dry air, and in consequence the barometer
is low. Wet and stormy weather usually follows.
When the air is clear and dry, then the barometer is
high, and good weather may be expected. The former
is called cyclonic, and the latter anti-cyclonic types of
weather. The atmospheric pressure varies as the
storm moves onward; hence there is usually a falling
barometer till the storm is over, succeeded by a rising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>barometer. The cyclone, as the storm is called, has
two motions, a circular motion opposite to the hands
of a clock, and a general forward movement as a whole,
usually from some point west to some point east. In
winter the deficiency of atmospheric pressure in the
neighbourhood of Iceland accounts for the procession
of westerly gales from the Atlantic during that season,
causing the southerly type of wind to prevail over
Shetland. In summer the area of low pressure is
over Central Asia, which produces a northerly type
of wind over the islands, and this corresponds with the
dry season of the year.</p>

<p>Take a typical cyclone moving from the Atlantic,
and passing, as it often does, between Shetland and
Iceland. The weather may be unnaturally warm
for the season of the year, the sky becomes overcast,
the wind backs to the south or south-east, and the
barometer falls rapidly. Other premonitory signs
may be a halo or “broch” round the sun or moon;
aurora (Merrie Dancers) high overhead; or a heavy
swell in the sea. Wind and rain follow; after a time
there may be a sudden lull; the wind shifts to the west
or north; the barometer rises briskly and the clouds
clear away, often with a strong gale of wind.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_129.jpg" alt="" width="419" height="700" />
<p class="captioncenter">Wind Roses showing the prevailing winds at Sumburgh Head</p>
</div>

<p>From November to February the prevailing winds
are from the south and west, averaging about 5 days
for each month, while October has an average of 7
days from the north. From March to June, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>prevailing winds are from the north and north-east,
which accounts for the cold spring and late summer, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>average being about 4¾ days for each of these months.
July is equally divided between west and north, having
5 days of each; while August has a total of 5 days
from the north and September 6 from the west. The
wind-rose shows that for the whole year the west wind
prevails with 17 per cent. while the east has only 4.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>January has 7 days of west wind and only 1 of
east; June has 6 days from the north-east, and 4
each from north and north-west. The average number
of days in the year with calm weather is 27, with
gales 37.</p>

<p class="hang50center"><strong>Graph showing the average Rainfall and Temperature for
each month of the year, from observations taken at
Sumburgh Head, extending over 35 years</strong></p></div>

<p>As might be expected from its insular position, the
climate of Shetland is moist, and the annual rainfall
is about 37 inches, while the number of rainy days in the
year amounts to 251. This is the record for Sumburgh
Head, extending over a period of thirty-five years;
but of course the rainfall varies considerably in different
parts of the islands. The wet period of the year embraces
the months of October, November, December and
January; while the dry period, if it can be called
such, includes May, June and July&mdash;May being driest.
Heavy falls of snow are not uncommon; but owing to
the sea-breezes and changeable weather, snow seldom
lies for any length of time.</p>

<p>The climate is somewhat cold, the mean temperature
for the year being 44.7 degrees, while the mean monthly
temperature varies from 38° in February and March,
the coldest months of the year, to 53° in August, the
warmest month. It is found that this mean annual
temperature closely approximates to the temperature
of the sea (from a depth of 100 fathoms to the bottom)
between the Hebrides and Faroe. Thunderstorms
are not frequent, and heat waves are usually followed
by fog, which is very prevalent in summer and greatly
impedes navigation round the coast. The month of
May has an average of 8 days of fog, June 12, July and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>August 10 each, while the whole year shows a total
of 75 days.</p>

<p>Winter in Shetland is dark and stormy; but this is
to a certain extent compensated for by the long days

when darkness is unknown. That season gives to the

<h2 class="left">10. People&mdash;Race, Language, Population</h2>


<p>That Shetland was inhabited from remote times is
evident from the number of primitive stone implements
found all over the islands. The rude hammer and axe;
the finely-polished celts and knives; the stone circles
and brochs; the burial mounds, with urns and stone
coffins&mdash;all bear mute testimony to successive stages
of progress towards civilisation. Who the earliest
inhabitants were it is not easy to discover; but it is
generally agreed that for a number of centuries the Picts
held sway till supplanted by invaders from Norway.
Norse influence began with Viking raids, and then
towards the end of the ninth century assumed the
form of conquest. Scandinavian domination lasted
till 1468. During this period the people were Norse
to a large extent in blood and altogether in language,
manners and customs; and although Scottish influence
has brought about many changes, yet the Shetlander
still retains many of the Norse characteristics of his
ancestors.</p>

<p>The spoken language is a Scottish dialect with a
mixture of Norse words&mdash;many thousands, says Jacob
Jacobsen&mdash;with accent and pronunication distinctly
Scandinavian. Some of its peculiarities are as follows:
<i>th</i> becomes <i>d</i> or <i>t</i>, as <i>dat eart</i> for <i>that earth</i>; <i>qu</i> as in
<i>squander</i> is sounded like <i>wh</i>; long <i>o</i> is shortened; <i>oo</i> in
<i>good</i> is modified (something like French <i>u</i>) and written <i>ü</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>as <i>güd</i>. This <i>ü</i> is the shibboleth of the dialect, and is
extremely difficult for any but a Shetlander to pronounce.</p>

<p>Nearly all the place names are of Norse origin. Islands
and rocks are denoted by <i>uy</i>, <i>holm</i>, <i>baa</i>, <i>skerry</i>, <i>drong</i>,
<i>stack</i>; openings along the coast by <i>voe</i>, <i>wick</i>, <i>firth</i>,
<i>ham</i>, <i>hoob</i>, <i>min</i>, <i>gio</i>, <i>gloop</i>, <i>helyer</i>; capes by <i>noss</i>, <i>noop</i>
or <i>neep</i>, <i>bard</i>, <i>mool</i>, <i>ness</i>, <i>taing</i>, <i>hevda</i> or <i>hevdi</i>,
rocks or cliffs by <i>clett</i>, <i>hellya</i>, <i>berry</i>, <i>bakka</i>, <i>berg</i>, <i>ord</i>;
inland heights by <i>wart</i> or <i>ward</i>, <i>vord</i>, <i>virdick</i>, <i>fell</i> or
<i>fil</i>, <i>hool</i>, <i>sneug</i>, <i>kame</i>, <i>coll</i> or <i>kool</i>, <i>roni</i>, <i>björg</i>; valleys
by <i>wall</i> or <i>vel</i>, <i>dal</i>, <i>grave</i> or <i>gref</i>, <i>gil</i>, <i>boiten</i>, <i>koppa</i>, <i>sloag</i>,
<i>quarf</i>, <i>wham</i>; fresh water by <i>vatn</i>, <i>fors</i>, <i>kelda</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>ljöag</i>,
<i>brun</i>; crofts and townships by <i>seter</i>, or <i>ster</i>, <i>bister</i>,
<i>skolla</i>, <i>taft</i>; enclosures by <i>garth</i>, <i>gard</i>, <i>gord</i>, <i>girt</i>, <i>gairdie</i>,
<i>krü</i>, <i>bü</i>, <i>toon</i>, <i>pund</i>, <i>hoga</i>, <i>hag</i>, <i>quhey</i>. An isthmus is
called <i>aid</i>; a Pictish broch is <i>burg</i> or <i>burra</i>. <i>Peti</i>
means Picts; <i>Finni</i>, Finns; <i>Papa</i> or <i>Papil</i> an Irish
missionary settlement.</p>

<p>A century ago the population was 22,379, and reached
its maximum (31,670) in 1861. After that it gradually
decreased, chiefly owing to emigration, to 27,911 in
1911. The density is about fifty to the square mile.</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left">11. Agriculture and other Industries</h2>


<p>As an agricultural county, Shetland is comparatively
poor, and that for various reasons. Although in certain
districts the soil is of good quality, and produces crops
that compare favourably with any Scottish county,
yet much of the land may be classed as indifferent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>or poor. Only 4 per cent. of the whole land surface
is arable. Permanent pasture might be 10 per cent.
Fourteen per cent. may thus be taken as the limit of
profitable agriculture. The other 86 per cent. is used for
grazing. Shetland is a crofting county, but most of the
holdings are too small to support a family, unless the men
have some subsidiary employment, either as fishermen or
sailors. Some 56 per cent. of the male population are
classed as farmers or fishermen, or both combined. The
result of this divided attention is seen in the backward
state of cultivation, up to very recent years. Another
important factor was insecurity of tenure. Before the
passing of the Crofters Act in 1886 there was no security,
and in many cases where a crofter improved his holding,
he had to pay increased rent for his pains. But matters
are now growing better. The crofter has a fair rent
fixed; his tenure is secure, so long as he conforms to
certain legal requirements; and with increased facilities
for placing his produce in the market, he has every
inducement to give of his labour and intelligence to
agricultural work. Up-to-date methods and tools are
taking the place of primitive ways and out-of-date
implements; and the Board of Agriculture is helping
to educate people into better methods of agriculture
and dairying. School gardening, now almost universal,
is also doing much to encourage the production and use
of garden vegetables.</p>

<p>There are 352,319 acres of land in the islands; and
of these, only 15,352 acres are under cultivation; while
35,472 acres are laid down to permanent grass. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>number of holdings in the islands is 3550, giving an
average of 14.3 acres to each holding. Of these, there
are 793 under 5 acres; 2021 between 5 and 15 acres;
563 between 15 and 30 acres; 97 between 30 and 50
acres; 40 between 50 and 100 acres; 30 between 100
and 300 acres; and 6 over 300 acres. It will thus be
seen that nearly 98 per cent. of the holdings are crofts
under 50 acres in extent. Of the arable land, oats is
the principal product, extending to 7291 acres, or nearly
one-half; while bere is grown on 1035 acres. Potatoes
take up 2795 acres and turnips the half of that, while
ryegrass covers 1067 acres. There are 288,962 acres
of hill pasture or “scattald” on which each crofter has
the right to graze a certain number of sheep, ponies or
cattle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_136.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="215" />
<p class="captioncenter">Single-Stilted Shetland Plough</p>
</div>

<p>The native sheep are diminutive in size; but the wool,
which is made into shawls and other articles, is well
known for its softness. Practically every Shetland
woman is a knitter; and although this may be reckoned
a subsidiary employment, it is a very important one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>Large quantities of knitted goods are sent out of the
islands every year; and the money obtained for them
is a welcome addition to the too often scanty earnings
of the crofter-fishermen. Over 2000 women are engaged
in agriculture, and nearly 3000 in making hosiery.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="442" />
<p class="captioncenter">Carding and Spinning</p>
</div>

<p>Besides the common grazing ground used by crofters,
there are large tracts enclosed as sheep-runs, in which
black-faced and other breeds are raised for the southern
markets. The total number of sheep in the islands in
1912 was 162,090.</p>

<p>The native breed of ponies&mdash;some of them as low as
seven hands&mdash;is well known. In days gone past they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>served a useful purpose as beasts of burden; but the
coming of roads and wheeled vehicles demanded a larger
and stronger type of animal; and now they are bred
chiefly for export, to be used in coal mines and for other
purposes. The picturesque sight of a long string of these
hardy and intelligent little animals, tied head and tail,
each with “kishies” fastened to “clibbers,” and the
whole strapped up with a “maishie,” wending their
way homeward with a load of peats, is now almost a
thing of the past, except in districts where roads are
few. Horses, large and small, number 5827.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_138.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="407" />
<p class="captioncenter">“Leading” Home the Peats</p>
</div>

<p>The native cow, like the sheep and the pony, is also
diminutive; but under favourable conditions gives a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>good supply of milk of excellent quality. There are
15,932 cattle in the islands, of which 6027 are milch-cows.</p>

<p>Except farming and fishing&mdash;with their allied occupations&mdash;industries
are few in Shetland. Lerwick has
two saw-mills. Freestone is quarried at the Knab
near Lerwick and at the Ord in Bressay. Copper ore
of good quality used to be mined at Sandlodge, and
chromate of iron in Unst; but the low prices for these
made working unprofitable, and now only a small
quantity of chromate is raised. Another bygone
industry is the making of kelp from seaweed&mdash;once
a source of considerable wealth. It may be revived, as
the war (1914) caused a scarcity of potash for use in
farming.</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left">12. Fishing</h2>


<p>For centuries it has been the custom&mdash;lately, however,
to a less extent&mdash;for the crofter-fisherman to fish in
the summer and to work on his farm during the rest
of the year. Every voe and creek had its fleet of small
boats engaged in line fishing; but owing to the depredations
of trawlers on the fishing grounds and other
adverse circumstances, the system gradually declined.
Line industry has now shrunk to very small dimensions,
and herring fishing has taken its place. At a few creeks
round the coast, small boats still engage in line fishing,
while at Lerwick and Scalloway there is a considerable
fleet of boats engaged in haddock and long-line fishing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>Haddocks and halibut are sent in ice to Aberdeen,
while other kinds of fish are salted and dried for export.
Lerwick and Scalloway have also kippering kilns.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_140.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="444" />
<p class="captioncenter">Dutch Fishing Fleet in Lerwick Harbour</p>
</div>

<p>From its position and other natural advantages,
Lerwick is an ideal fishing centre, and is now one of the
chief fishery ports in Scotland. The Harbour Trustees
have provided pier accommodation, erected a fish
market, and in other ways met the demands of this
industry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_141.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="432" />
<p class="captioncenter">Steam Drifters and Fish Market, Lerwick</p>
</div>

<p>Round the harbour and along the shores of Bressay
Sound a large number of curing yards are erected,
each with its wooden jetty, at which the herrings are
discharged. There they are taken in hand by a staff
of men and women, who clean and salt them in barrels.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>They used to be shipped to the Continent&mdash;chiefly
to Russia and Germany&mdash;through Hamburg and the
Baltic ports of Petrograd, Libau, Riga, Stettin, Konigsberg,
and Dantzig.</p>

<p>The fish-offal is collected from the various fishing
stations and taken to the factories in Bressay, where
up-to-date machinery converts the raw material into
articles of commerce, as fish meal for feeding cattle
and pigs; oil for tanning; stearin for soap-making;
and manure.</p>

<p>Other fishing ports are Baltasound, Sandwick, Whalsay
and Scalloway. There and at other centres herring
fishing is carried on by sailing boats as well as steam
drifters. In other districts deserted curing yards may
be seen&mdash;relics of the formerly prosperous fishing
stations.</p>

<p>The number of boats of all kinds fishing round the
Shetland coast in 1913 was 952, and of these 551 were
sailing boats with 2332 native men and boys. The
number of drifters working from Lerwick and other
ports was 380, with 3800 men, mostly Scottish and
English fishermen. In addition, there were 5 drifters
and 16 motor-boats owned locally, with 99 native and
10 non-resident men engaged. The total value of all
these vessels, with their gear, was estimated at
£1,045,839. The total quantity of fish landed amounted
to 38,585 tons, valued at £347,894. This included
shell-fish, herring, mackerel, ling, cod, tusk, saithe,
haddock, whiting, halibut, skate, plaice, and dabs.
Besides the 6241 persons actually engaged in fishing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
this important industry gave employment to about
4000 other workers&mdash;gutters, coopers, carters, labourers,
and sailors.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_143.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="501" />
<p class="captioncenter">Shoal of Whales</p>
</div>

<p>Shetland had three whaling stations, Olna Firth,
Ronas Voe, and Colla Firth. The men employed were
mostly Norwegians.</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left">13. Shipping and Trade</h2>


<p>Long after Shetland was annexed to Scotland, trade
and friendly intercourse continued to be carried on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>with Norway and other countries across the North Sea.
Dutch and Flemish fishermen also frequented the
islands, and established a considerable trade, exchanging
foreign produce for fish and articles of native manufacture.
There was regular communication with Bergen,
Hamburg, Bremen and other Continental ports; and
people from Shetland often travelled to Scotland and
England by way of the Continent. As time went on,
more direct communication was established with
Scotland by means of sailing vessels. Trade was carried
on by these till the advent of a steamship in 1836,
when the paddle-boat <em>Sovereign</em> began to ply
between Granton and Lerwick once a fortnight&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>afterwards
once a week&mdash;calling at Aberdeen, Wick and
Kirkwall. At the present time four steamers regularly
arrive from Leith or Aberdeen each week during
summer. One of these makes a weekly trip to
Scalloway and ports on the west side. Lerwick is the
port of call on the east. In addition to these, another
of the North of Scotland Company’s steamers does the
coast-wise trade on the east side and to the North Isles.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_144.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="463" />
<p class="captioncenter">A Busy Day at Victoria Pier, Lerwick</p>
</div>

<p>All goods, mails and passengers to and from Scotland
are carried by this company’s steamers. The imports
consist of meal and flour; tea, sugar and butter;
feeding-stuffs for cattle; and the miscellaneous articles
that form the stock-in-trade of the draper, the grocer,
the ironmonger, and the general merchant’s store in
town and country. The exports include eggs, dried
and fresh fish, wool, hosiery, sheep, ponies and cattle,
and cured herrings. Timber is brought direct from
Norway. Coal, salt and empty barrels are imported in
specially chartered vessels.</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left">14. History</h2>


<p>Little is known for certain of Shetland in early times.
If by Thule, visited and described by Pytheas of Massilia,
the ancients meant Shetland, then the first mention of
the islands in our era is when Tacitus, telling of Agricola’s
fleet in 84 <small>A.D.</small> says “Dispecta est et Thule,” assuming
that it was really part of Mainland that the sailors
descried in the dim distance. Irish missionaries
christianised the natives in the sixth and seventh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>centuries. The nearness of the islands to Norway
naturally led to visits from the Viking raiders and finally
to conquest and settlement by them in the ninth century.
The Norsemen found two races of people&mdash;the Peti
or Picts, and the Papae, descendants of the Irish missionaries.
Whether these were exterminated or absorbed
by the invaders is disputed; but Christianity disappeared
before Odin, Thor and other Scandinavian
deities.</p>

<p>For several centuries after this, the history of Shetland
is hardly separable from the history of Orkney, and

that has been already narrated.<a name="fnanchor_3_3" id="fnanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Though both groups
of islands formed one earldom, Orkney was the predominant
partner. Shetland received scant attention
except as a recruiting ground for fleets or armies. From
1195 to 1379 Shetland was disjoined from Orkney; and,
while the latter came more and more under Scottish
influence, the former remained under Norse. It was
during the period of separation that Norse influence
impressed itself most strongly on Shetland.</p>

<div class="footnote">

See <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_43" title="Go to page 43">43</a> <i>sqq.</i></p></div>

<p>Norse Shetland had its Althing or Parliament, meeting
on the holm in Tingwall Loch under the presidency of
the Foud. Each district had its lesser Thing (as Aithsting,
Nesting) and its under-Foud, who selected Raadmen
or Councillors, and was assisted by the Lawmen or
Legal Assessors. The Lawrightman superintended the
weights and measures&mdash;an important office, since rents
and duties were paid in kind. The Ranselman was a
kind of parish constable.</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>
<h2 class="left">15. Antiquities</h2>


<p>The most conspicuous remains of antiquity in the
islands are the Pictish castles or brochs,<a name="fnanchor_4_4" id="fnanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of which there
are seventy or eighty. Most of them are in ruins; but
the one notable exception is that of Mousa Castle, the
most perfect of its kind in existence. Another broch
is in the loch of Clickimin. Though only a remnant,
it conveys a good idea of the massive structure of these
buildings.</p>

<p>Standing stones occur in every parish. Other prehistoric
relics are the stone circles, the earth-houses or
underground dwellings, and “pechts knowes.” The
last are artificial mounds of burnt stones and earth.
In some of these are found stone coffins or cists, in others
urns containing the ashes of the dead.</p>

<p>Implements and weapons of the Stone Age are being
continually unearthed. Some are rough and include
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>hammers, clubs, whorls for spinning, stones for pounding
corn, whetstones, vessels for liquids. Others are
polished, and show a great advance on the rough in
workmanship. These include celts or axes of porphyry
or serpentine, locally known as “thunderbolts” and
held in veneration by the finder. Another polished
weapon is the knife, said to be found only in Shetland.</p>

<p>Scalloway Castle was built by Earl Patrick Stewart
in 1600, at a time when Scalloway was the capital and
the only town in Shetland. Over the gateway was
a Latin inscription, adapted from the New Testament
contrast between the house founded on a rock and the
house founded on the sand&mdash;</p>

<p class="captioncenter">Town Hall, Lerwick</p>
  <p class="captioncenter">(Midnight, June)</p>
</div>

<p>The only building of architectural significance in
Lerwick is the Town Hall, a handsome Gothic building,
erected in 1882. Its external decorations include the
arms of the town and of the nobles who were connected
with the government of Shetland. The main hall is
the chief centre of interest. Its beautiful stained-glass
windows present a magnificent series of pictures representing
the history of the islands from the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>of the Norwegian conquest to James <abbr title="3">III</abbr> of Scotland,
who married Margaret of Denmark.</p>
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left">17. Communications</h2>


<p>Till the middle of last century Shetland was almost
devoid of roads. All traffic had to go by water, while
travelling by land was on foot or on horseback over
moorland tracks. The failure of the potato crop in 1846
and following years caused much distress in the islands;
and the food and money sent by the Board for the Relief
of Destitution in the Highlands enabled labour to be
hired for road-making. Between 1849 and 1852 about
120 miles of roads were constructed, joining Lerwick
with Dunrossness on the south, with Scalloway and
Walls on the west, and with Lunna, Mossbank and
Hillswick on the north; while a road 17 miles long was
constructed through Yell. Under the Zetland Roads
Act (1864) roads were improved and extended all over
the islands. The County Council now manages all
roads and bridges.</p>

<p>The southern terminus of the main road is Grutness,
near Sumburgh. From this point to Lerwick the road
skirts the east side of the island, with branches leading
to various districts. From Lerwick the north road
begins by climbing the hill of Fitch. At the bridge of
Fitch a branch diverges to Scalloway; and further on,
at Tingwall, is the junction of another route to the
ancient capital. Here the main road bifurcates, one
fork going in a westerly direction through Whiteness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>Weisdale, Aithsting, Walls and Sandness, and terminating
at Huxter. The other fork after passing Girlsta
and Sandwater, enters the dreary Lang Kame, a stretch
of five miles without a single habitation, where, says
superstition, the benighted traveller may meet “Da
Trows,” the goblins of Norse mythology. The road
then runs by the Loch of Voe to Olnafirth Kirk. Here
it divides&mdash;going on the right by Dales Voe to Mossbank,
on the left to the narrow neck between Busta Voe and
Sullom Voe and thence by Mavis Grind past Punds
Water. Again it branches, to Ollaberry on the right
and Hillswick on the left. In Yell the chief road runs
from Burra Voe to Cullivoe in the north-east. The
trunk road in Unst&mdash;the best in the islands&mdash;stretches
from Uyeasound to Norwich.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="left">18. Roll of Honour</h2>


<p>Although Shetland has produced no names of worldwide
celebrity, yet many sons of the “Old Rock” have
risen to distinction both at home and abroad.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_158.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="500" />
<p class="captioncenter">Arthur Anderson</p>
</div>

<p>The first place must be given to Arthur Anderson,
(1792-1868), who, commencing life as a humble fish-worker
at Gremista, near Lerwick, was in 1840 one of
the founders of the P. and O. Steamship Company,
and ultimately its chairman. Much of his wealth he
spent on Shetland. He established the first newspaper
in the islands&mdash;<cite>The Shetland Journal</cite>; he started the
Shetland Fishing Company, which largely helped to
emancipate the crofter-fishermen from their bondage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>to the landlords; he introduced Shetland hosiery to the
outside world; he was influential in securing steam
communication between the islands and Scotland; and,
not to mention more of his benefactions, he founded the
Anderson Educational Institute, which is now administered
by the Education Authority as a Higher
Grade School and Junior Student Centre for the county.
Another benefactor was R. P. Gilbertson, a colonial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>merchant, who presented the Gilbertston Park to
Lerwick and founded the Gilbertson Trust for the
benefit of Shetlanders.</p>

<p>The islands boast a goodly array of writers, and
among these the Edmonston family stands conspicuous.
Dr Arthur Edmonston (1775-1841) wrote <cite>A View of the
Ancient and Present State of the Zetland Islands</cite>; his
brother Laurence (1795-1879) was a distinguished
Scandinavian scholar and the author of many papers
on natural history; Laurence’s son, Thomas, born in
1825, was the discoverer of the Shetland plant <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arenaria
Norvegica</i>, and the author of a <cite>Flora of Shetland</cite>. At
the age of twenty he was elected Professor of Botany
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>and Natural History in Anderson’s College at
Glasgow; but next year he was accidentally shot dead
in Peru, while on a scientific expedition to the Pacific;
Thomas’s brother, Biot (1827-1906) was joint-author
with his sister Mrs Saxby, of <cite>The Home of a Naturalist</cite>.
Dr Saxby wrote <cite>The Birds of Shetland</cite>. Thomas Gifford
of Busta, who died in 1760, was the author of <cite>Historical
Description of the Zetland Isles</cite>; Dr Robert Cowie, of
<cite>Shetland: Descriptive and Historical</cite>; Dr Copeland, of <cite>A
Dictionary of Medicine</cite>; Miss Spence, of <cite>Earl Rognvald
and his Forebears</cite>, and a <cite>Memoir of Arthur Laurenson</cite>, a
scholar deeply versed in Scandinavian lore; Gilbert
Goudie, of <cite>Antiquities of Shetland</cite>, and other works;
and John Spence, of <cite>Shetland Folk Lore</cite>. Of minor
poets and vernacular writers we may name Basil R.
Anderson; Laurence J. Nicolson, “The Bard of Thule”;
George Stewart; T. P. Ollason; and J. B. Laurence.</p>

<p>Of men who have risen to distinction in the Government
service, the best known is Sir Robert G. C.
Hamilton (1836-1895), a son of Dr Hamilton of Bressay.
He was at various times Accountant-General of the
Navy, Under-Secretary for Ireland, Governor of Tasmania,
and Chairman of the Board of Customs.</p>

<p><b>Lerwick</b> (4664), the capital and the only burgh of the
county, and the most northerly town in Britain, lies on
the west side of Bressay Sound, which forms a safe and
commodious harbour. During the Dutch War, Cromwell
built and garrisoned the fort. This may be taken as the
beginning of the town. In 1781 the fort was put into a
state of defence, and named Fort Charlotte in honour of
George <abbr title="3">III</abbr>’s Queen. It is now a Coast Guard Station
and Royal Naval Reserve Headquarters. The Old Town,
built on the side of a hill facing the harbour, has one narrow
and irregular street running parallel to the shore, with
numerous lanes branching off at right angles. Some of the
houses at the south end of the town are built right into
the sea; but elsewhere, the shore has been reclaimed,
and an esplanade and wharves take the place of the “Lodberries”
of former times. Victoria Pier (erected in 1888),
Alexandra Wharf with the Fish Market, and the Boat
Harbour, are among the latest harbour improvements.
The New Town, which lies on the landward side of the
hill, has wide streets and modern houses, the Central
School being the principal building; while near by is the
Gilbert Bain Hospital. The Docks are situated at the
north end of the town, and here also are boat-building
sheds, saw-mills and barrel factories. Adjoining the</p>

<p>Anderson Institute is a Hostel for country girl-bursars
attending the Institute. This handsome building, the
gift of Robert H. Bruce, Esq., of Sumburgh, is the first
building of its kind in Scotland. Lerwick has two weekly
newspapers&mdash;<cite>The Shetland Times</cite> and <cite>The Shetland News</cite>.
At Sound, in the vicinity, is a Government wireless station.

<h3 title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
